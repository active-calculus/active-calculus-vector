    <p>
      As we saw in <xref ref="S_12_1_VectorFields">Section</xref>, there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is  "Where exactly is the vector field created?" With the vector field in <xref ref="fig_test">Figure</xref>, you can see that the vector field increases in strength as you move along the flow. So we wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.

    		<title> Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field</title>
      		
	        <p> 
	        	In this section, we will go through the process for how to measure the density of the "creation" or "destruction" of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point, then using a limit we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because our vector fields will change in a continous fashion, we won't have the vector field actually change at a single point. Rather we will really be measuring the density for the change in strength of the vector field. 
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	    		We will develop these measurements in a two dimensional setting for now, but our arguments can be generalized and applied to three (or more!) dimensions. Let's start in the same fashion as in <xref ref="Divergence_PA">Preview Activity</xref>, namely we will look at how much of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered at our point <m>(a,b)</m>.
	    	</p>
		    <figure xml:id="S_12_5_box">
		      <caption><p>A square around the point <m>(a,b)</m></p></caption>
		      <image source="images/fig_12_5_box.svg"/>
		    </figure>
		
            <p>
               We can parameterize the top edge of the box (in red) using the parameter <m> -h\geq t\geq h</m> as <m>\vr(t) = \langle a+t,b+h\rangle</m>.
           </p>
            
            <p>
              We can find out much of our vector field is created in a square around the point <m>(a,b)</m> but measuring the net amount of the vector field coming in or going out of our square. 
          	</p>
            <p>
            	If we want to measure how much of our vector field <m>\vF</m> goes through the top of our square (in blue on the figure), which component of <m>\vF</m>do we need to pay attention to? Explain why we only need to pay attention to this component on the top section of our square. 
            </p> 
            	<answer><p> <m>F_2</m> since we need only pay attention to the vertical component, since none of the horizontal component of the vector field goes through the top part of our square.</p> </answer>
            	<solution><p> <m>F_2</m> since we need only pay attention to the vertical component, since none of the horizontal component of the vector field goes through the top part of our square.</p></solution>
            


        
        	<p>The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square (in orange). Similarly, if we want to measure how much of <m>\vF</m> goes through either the left or right side of the square, we only need to use the horizontal component, <m>F_1</m>. Since our vector field changes with each point, we will need to measure the accumulation of our vector field flow</p>
