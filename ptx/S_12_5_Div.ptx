<introduction>
<p>
As we saw in <xref ref="S_12_1_VectorFields">Section</xref>, there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is  "Where exactly is the vector field created?" With the vector field in <xref ref="Div_fig_vf1">Figure</xref>, you can see that the vector field increases in strength as you move along the flow. So we wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.

    <title> Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field</title>
    <p>
        In this section, we will go through the process for how to measure the density of the "creation" or "destruction" of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point. Then using a limit we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because our vector fields will change in a continous fashion, we won't have the vector field actually change at a single point. Rather we will really be measuring the density for the change in strength of the vector field.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will develop these measurements in a two dimensional setting for now, but our arguments can be generalized and applied to three (or more!) dimensions. Let's start in the same fashion as in <xref ref="Divergence_PA">Preview Activity</xref>, namely we will look at how much of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered at our point <m>(a,b)</m>. For this development we will have a two dimensionial vector field given by <m> \vF(x,y)=\langle F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y)\rangle</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="S_12_5_box">
        <caption>A square around the point <m>(a,b)</m></caption>
        <image width="55%" source="images/fig_12_5_box.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
        We can parameterize the top edge of the box (in red) using the parameter <m> -h\leq t\leq h</m> as <m>\vr_{top}(t) = \langle a+t,b+h\rangle</m>. Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parameterized by  <m>\vr_{bottom}(t) = \langle a+t,b-h\rangle</m>,  <m>\vr_{right}(t) = \langle a+h,b+t\rangle</m>, and  <m>\vr_{left}(t) = \langle a-h,b+t\rangle</m> with <m> -h\leq t\leq h</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can find out much of our vector field is created inside the square around our point, <m>(a,b)</m>, by measuring the net amount of the vector field coming in or going out of our square. The amount of vector flow that goes through each of the boundary segments can be measured by looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field (on each particular segment). For instance, on the top segement (in red) the vertical component determines how much of the vector field goes in or out of the square. Integrating the vertical component of the vector field over the points on the top segement of our square will therefore measure how much of the vector field goes through the top of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square (in orange). Similarly, if we want to measure how much of <m>\vF</m> goes through either the left or right side of the square, we need to integrate the horizontal component, <m>F_1</m>. So the net flow of the vector field in to or out of the square will be given by
    </p>
<!--Need to number this equation for reference. How do I do that? -->
    <me>
        \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt \\
        \quad + \int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt
   	</me>
    <p>
        Note that some of the integrals are subtracted because we need to pay attention to the orientation of the vector field relative to the square. A positive vertical component of the vector field (<m>F_2</m>) will correspond to flow out on the top of the square but will correspond to the vector field flowing into the square on the bottom. So in the integrals above, we are counting the flow out of the square as positive and the flow in as negative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that what we are measuring the net flow through the square with a scalar quantity. We can look at what happens to our scalar quantity as we  shrink our square to a point. In order for this to make the most sense, we will change our measurement to be a density argument (flow in/out per unit area), that way we can compare our results with different areas. In other words, we want to consider what happens to 
        <me>
    	    \frac{1}{(2h)^2}\left(\int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt  \\
            \quad \quad +\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt \right)
        </me>
        as <m>h</m> goes to zero. We will take a moment here before we apply our limit to simplify our integrals in order to make the limit easier to evaluate. In particular, we will apply the Mean Value Theorem to each of four the integrals above. Applying Mean Value Theorem to the first integral gives 
        <me> 
            \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt = (2h) F_2(t^*_1,b+h)
        </me>
        where <m>t^*_1</m> is some value in the interval <m> (a-h,a+h)</m>. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to each of the other integrals yeilds the following:
            <me>
	     		\int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt + \\
        	 	\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt = \\
        	 	(2h) \left(F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)+F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)\right)
    		</me>
        where <m>t^*_1,t^*_2</m> are values in <m>(a-h,a+h)</m> and <m>t^*_3,t^*_4</m> are values in <m>(b-h,b+h)</m>. Thus our flow density can be measured by looking at the limit as <m>h</m> goes to zero of the net flow (in or out) over the square divided by the area of the square.
            <me> 
                \verb"Flow Density"(a,b)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\verb"net flow"}{\verb"area"} =\\
    			\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{(2h) \left(F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)+F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)\right)}{4h^2}
    		</me>
        If we reorganize our new limit expression a little bit, we will be able to simplify the limit easily. Namely, let's collect the <m>F_2</m> and <m>F_1</m> terms separately.
            <me> 
                \verb"Flow Density"(a,b)=
    			\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)}{2h}+\frac{F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)}{2h}
    		</me>
        Recall the central difference method of evaluating derivatives from page 48 (1.5.2) and notice that as <m>h</m> goes to zero, then <m>t^*_1,t^*_2</m> must go to <m>a</m> and <m>t^*_3,t^*_4</m> must go to <m>b</m>. Therefore, our flow density ends up being
            <me> 
                \verb"Flow Density"(a,b)= \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} (a,b)+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} (a,b)
    		</me>
        While this simplification may seem a bit amazing and magical, our conceptual steps should help us make sense of the result. If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point <m>(a,b)</m> then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. How the horizontal component changes over small steps in the vertical direction will give us information about how the direction of the vector field changes but not how the strength of the vector field is changing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The arguments we made about measuring how much of the vector field flows into or out of a square can be generalized to three (or more!) dimensions but requires the measurement of flow through a surface, which will be talked about in <xref ref="S_12_flux_int">Section</xref>.
    </p>
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="Div_defn_section">
    <title> Definition of the Divergence of a Vector Field</title>
    <p>
        We define the measurment of the how the strength of the vector field changes (as a density argument) as the divergence of a vector field.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="Div_defn">
        <statement>
        <p>
            The divergence of a vector field <m>\vF(x,y)=\langle F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y)\rangle</m> is given by
            <me>
           		div(\vF)=\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y}
	        </me>
            In three dimensions, <m>\vF(x,y)=\langle F_1(x,y,z),F_2(x,y,z),F_3(x,y,z)\rangle</m> is given by 
            <me> 
	       		div(\vF)=\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}
        	</me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    In other sources you may see the divergence written using a dot product in the following way
        <me>
	    	div(\vF)= \nabla \cdot \vF = \\
	    	\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle \cdot \langle F_1,F_2,F_3 \rangle = \\
	    	\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(F_1)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(F_2)+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(F_3) = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}
		</me>
    This notation is very compact and works well with the understanding that the del operator (<m>\nabla  = \langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle</m>) is a function that operates on other functions. This notation can be a bit confusing and in this text, we will not generally write the divergence using the del operator.

        As we saw in <xref ref="div_activity">Activity</xref>, when the divergence is positive, that means that the vector field is increasing in strength. Another way to see divergence in a vector field plot is to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector field, then the divergence is zero. Also remember that the divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and will change depending on location.
