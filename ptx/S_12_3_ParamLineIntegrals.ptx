      We begin this section by taking a look at how we can calculate a line integral of a vector field along some line segments and use this calculation as inspiration to see how treating oriented curves as vector-valued functions will allow us to quickly turn a line integral of a vector field into a single variable integral.

    <title>Parameterizations in the Definition of <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m></title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="PA_12_3">Preview Activity</xref> has shown us that it is possible to evaluate line integrals without needing to resort to working with Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line segments. Fortunately, parameterizing the oriented curve along which a line integral is calculated provides a powerful tool for evaluating line integrals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that <m>C</m> is an oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>,
      and let <m>\vF</m> be a continuous vector field defined near <m>C</m>. We can divide the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m>
      subintervals, each of length <m>\Delta t = (b-a)/n</m>, by letting <m>t_i = a + i\Delta t</m> for <m>i = 0,1,\dots,n</m>.
      This subdivision of <m>[a,b]</m> then can be used to break <m>C</m> up into <m>n</m> pieces by letting <m>\Delta \vr_i =
      \vr(t_{i+1}) - \vr(t_{i})</m> for <m>i=0,1,\dots,n-1</m>. Now notice that
      <me>
        \Delta \vr_i = \vr(t_{i+1}) - \vr(t_{i}) = \vr(t_{i} + \Delta t) -
        \vr(t_{i}) = \frac{\vr(t_{i} + \Delta t) -
        \vr(t_{i})}{\Delta t}\Delta t
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the ratio in the last expression for <m>\Delta \vr_i</m> is approximately <m>\vr'(t_{i})</m>, we can say that <m>\Delta\vr_i\approx \vr'(t_i)\Delta t</m>. Substituting this into the Reimann sum in the definition of the line integral, we have
      <me>
        \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \lim_{|\Delta\vr_i|\to 0}
        \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta\vr_i = \lim_{\Delta t\to
        0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \vF(\vr(t_i))\cdot \vr'(t_i)\Delta t
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This final Riemann sum is <m>\int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt</m>, allowing us to reduce the evaluation of a line integral of a vector-valued function along an oriented curve to an ordinary integral of a function of one variable, since after evaluating the dot product, <m>\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)</m> is (scalar) function of <m>t</m>. We restate this result below for easy reference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>C</m> be a smooth, oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m> and let <m>\vF</m> be a continuous vector field defined near <m>C</m>. Then
      <me>
        \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vF(x,y) = x\vi + y^2\vj</m> and let <m>C</m> be the quarter of the circle of radius <m>3</m> from <m>(0,3)</m> to <m>(3,0)</m>. This vector field and curve are shown in <xref ref="F_12_3_field-quarter-circle">Figure</xref>. By properties of line integrals, we know that <m>\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = -\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, and we will use this property since <m>-C</m> is the usual clockwise orientation of a circle, meaning we can parameterize <m>-C</m> by <m>\vr(t) = \langle 3\cos(t),3\sin(t)\rangle</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq \pi/2</m>.
        </p>

          <image source="images/fig_12_3_field_quarter_circle_sage"/>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
          To evaluate <m>\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> using this parameterization, we need to note that
          <me>
            \vF(\vr(t)) = \langle 3\cos(t) , 9\sin^2(t)\rangle\qquad\text{ and } \vr'(t) = \langle -3\sin(t),3\cos(t)\rangle
          </me>.

    <title>Alternative Notation for Line Integrals</title>
    <p>
      In contexts where the fact that the quantity we are measuring via a line integral is best measured via a dot product (such as calculating work), the notation we have used thus far for line integrals is fairly common. However, sometimes the vector field is such that the units on <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> are not distances. In this case, a dot product may not have a physical meaning, and an alternative notation using differentials can be common. Specifically, if <m>\vF(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk</m>, then
      <me>
        \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy + F_3\, dz
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (If <m>\vF</m> is a vector field in <m>\R^2</m>, the <m>F_3\, dz</m> term is omitted.) As a concrete example, if <m>\vF(x,y,z) = \langle x^2y,z^3,x\cos(z)\rangle</m> and <m>C</m> is some oriented curve in <m>\R^3</m>, then
      <me>
        \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_C x^2y\, dx + z^3\, dy + x\cos(z)\, dz
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to recognize that the integral on the right-hand side is still a line integral and must be evaluated using techniques for evaluating line integrals. We cannot simply try to treat it as if it were a definite integral of a function of one variable.
    </p>

    <title>Independence of Parameterization</title>
    <p>
      Up to this point, we've just been choosing whatever parameterization of an oriented curve <m>C</m> came to mind, and our argument for how we can use parameterizations to calculate line integrals did not depend on the specific choice of parameterization. However, it is not immediately obvious that different parameterizations don't result in different values of the line integral. Our next example explores this question.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_12_3_param-indep">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>\vF = x\vi</m>. Let us consider two different oriented curves from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m>. The first oriented curve <m>C</m> travels horizontally to <m>(3,1)</m> and then proceeds vertically to <m>(3,3)</m>. The second oriented curve <m>C_3</m> is the line segment from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m>. Notice that, as depicted in
          <xref ref="F_12_3_x-field-triangle">Figure</xref>, we can break <m>C</m> up into two oriented curves <m>C_1</m> (the horizontal portion) and <m>C_2</m> (the vertical portion) so that <m>C = C_1 + C_2</m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F_12_3_x-field-triangle">
          <caption>The vector field <m>\vF = x\vi</m> and some oriented curves.</caption>
          <image source="images/fig_12_3_field_triangle_rev"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We first note that since <m>\vF</m> is orthogonal to <m>C_2</m>, <m>\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr=0</m>; threfore <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr =\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. We can parameterize <m>C_1</m> as just <m>x\vi+\vj</m> for <m>0\leq x\leq 3</m>, which leads to
          <me>
            \int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_0^3\langle x,0\rangle\cdot \langle 1,0\rangle\, dx = \int_0^3 x\, dx = \frac{9}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 9/2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we look at <m>\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, but we parameterize <m>C_3</m> in a bit of a nonstandard way by letting
          <m>\vr(t) = \langle 3\sin(t),1+2\sin(t)\rangle</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. Then <m>\vr'(t) = \langle 3\cos(t),2\cos(t)\rangle</m>, and
          <me>
            \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_0^{\pi/2}\langle
            3\sin(t),0\rangle\cdot\langle 3\cos(t),2\cos(t)\rangle\, dt =
            \int_0^{\pi/2} 9\sin(t)\cos(t)\, dt = \frac{9}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next activity, you are asked to consider the more typical parameterization of <m>C_3</m> and verify that using it gives the same value for the line integral.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also worth observing here that <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, so at least two (very different) paths from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m> give the same value of the line integral here. The next section will further investigate this phenomenon and when it happens.

          If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are different paths from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>, it is possible for <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> to have a different value to <m>\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.

          Line integrals of vector fields along oriented curves can be evaluated by parameterizing the curve in terms of <m>t</m> and then calculating the integral of <m>\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.

          The line integral <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> can also be written as <m>\int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy</m> if <m>\vF = \langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> is a vector field in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy + F_3\, dz</m> if <m>\vF = \langle F_1,F_2,F_3\rangle</m> is a vector field in <m>\R^3</m>.
