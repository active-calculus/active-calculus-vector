            If a parameterization is used to calculate
            <m>\int_C\vF\cdot
            d\vr</m>, does the parameterization chosen alter the value of the line integral?

      We begin this section by taking a look at how we might go about
      calculating a line integral of a vector field along some line segments
      and will use this as inspiration to see how treating oriented curves
      as vector-valued functions can allow us to quickly turn a line
      integral of a vector field into an integral of a single variable.

        <li>
          <p>
            Every point along <m>C_1</m> has <m>y=1</m>.
            Therefore, along <m>C_1</m>, the
            vector field <m>\vF</m> can be viewed purely as a function of <m>x</m>.
            In
            particular, along <m>C_1</m>,
            we have <m>\vF(x,1) = \langle
            x,1\rangle</m>.
            Since every point along <m>C_2</m> has the same <m>x</m>-value, what
            (in terms
            of <m>y</m> only)
            is <m>\vF</m> along <m>C_2</m>?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Recall that <m>d\vr \approx \Delta \vr</m>,
            and along <m>C_1</m>, we have
            that <m>\Delta\vr = \Delta x\vi \approx dx\vi</m>.
            Thus, <m>d\vr = \langle
            dx,0\rangle</m>.
            We know that along <m>C_1</m>, <m>\vF = \langle
            x,1\rangle</m>.
            What does this mean <m>\vF\cdot d\vr</m> is along <m>C_1</m>?
            What interval of <m>x</m>-values describes <m>C_1</m>?
            Use these facts
            fact to write <m>\int_{C_1} \vF\cdot d\vr</m> as an integral of the form
            <m>\int_a^b f(x)\, dx</m> and evaluate the integral.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use an analogous approach to write <m>\int_{C_2} \vF\cdot d\vr</m> as
            a limit of the form <m>\int_\alpha^\beta g(y)\, dy</m> and evaluate the
            integral.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use the previous parts and a property of line integrals to
            calculate <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> without having to evaluate any
            additional integrals.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Evaluating <m>\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> takes more work at this
            stage, so let's break the process into smaller pieces.

    <title>Parameterizations in the Definition of <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m></title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="PA_12_3">Preview Activity</xref>
      has shown us that it is possible to
      evaluate line integrals without needing to resort to working with
      Riemann sums directly.
      However, the approaches taken there seem rather
      cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line
      segments.
      Fortunately, parameterizing the oriented curve along which a
      line integral is calculated provides a powerful tool for evaluating
      line integrals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that <m>C</m> is an oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued
      function <m>\vr(t)</m> for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>,
      and let <m>\vF</m> be a continuous
      vector field defined near <m>C</m>.
      We can divide the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m>
      subintervals,
      each of length <m>\Delta t = (b-a)/n</m>, by letting
      <m>t_i = a
      + i\Delta t</m> for <m>i = 0,1,\dots,n</m>.
      This subdivision of <m>[a,b]</m> then
      can be used to break <m>C</m> up into <m>n</m> pieces by letting
      <m>\Delta \vr_i =
      \vr(t_{i+1}) - \vr(t_{i})</m> for <m>i=0,1,\dots,n-1</m>.
      Now notice that
      <me>
        \Delta \vr_i = \vr(t_{i+1}) - \vr(t_{i}) = \vr(t_{i} + \Delta t) -
        \vr(t_{i}) = \frac{\vr(t_{i} + \Delta t) -
        \vr(t_{i})}{\Delta t}\Delta t
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the ratio in the last expression for <m>\Delta \vr_i</m> is
      approximately <m>\vr'(t_{i})</m>,
      we can say that <m>\Delta\vr_i\approx
      \vr'(t_i)\Delta t</m>.
      Substituting this into the Reimann sum in the
      definition of the line integral, we have
      <me>
        \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \lim_{|\Delta\vr_i|\to 0}
        \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta\vr_i = \lim_{\Delta t\to
        0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \vF(\vr(t_i))\cdot \vr'(t_i)\Delta t
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This final Riemann sum is <m>\int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt</m>,
      allowing us to reduce the evaluation of a line integral of a
      vector-valued function along an oriented curve to an ordinary integral
      of a function of one variable,
      since after evaluating the dot product,
      <m>\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)</m> is (scalar) function of <m>t</m>.
      We restate
      this result below for easy reference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>C</m> be a smooth, oriented curve traced out by the
      vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m> and let
      <m>\vF</m> be a continuous vector field defined near <m>C</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vF(x,y) = x\vi + y^2\vj</m> and let <m>C</m> be the quarter of the circle of
          radius <m>3</m> from <m>(0,3)</m> to <m>(3,0)</m>.
          This vector field and curve are
          shown in <xref ref="F_12_3_field-quarter-circle">Figure</xref>.
          By properties of line integrals,
          we know that <m>\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = -\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, and
          we will use this property since <m>-C</m> is the usual clockwise
          orientation of a circle, meaning we can parameterize <m>-C</m> by
          <m>\vr(t)
          = \langle 3\cos(t),3\sin(t)\rangle</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq \pi/2</m>.

        </figure>

        <p>
          To evaluate <m>\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> using this parameterization, we
          need to note that
          <me>
            \vF(\vr(t)) = \langle 3\cos(t) , 9\sin^2(t)\rangle\qquad\text{ and } 
            \vr'(t) = \langle -3\sin(t),3\cos(t)\rangle
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr \amp = -\int_{-C}\vF\cdot d\vr = -\int_0^{\pi/2}

            <mrow>\amp  = -\int_0^1 (-9 u + 27u^2)\, du = -\left[ -\frac{9}{2}u^2 +

    <title>Alternative Notation for Line Integrals</title>
    <p>
      In contexts where the fact that the quantity we are measuring via a
      line integral is best measured via a dot product
      (such as calculating
      work),
      the notation we have used thus far for line integrals is fairly
      common.
      However, sometimes the vector field is such that the units on
      <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> are not distances.
      In this case, a dot product may
      not have a physical meaning, and an alternative notation using
      differentials can be common.
      Specifically, if <m>\vF(x,y,z) =
      F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk</m>, then
      <me>
        \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy + F_3\, dz
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (If <m>\vF</m> is a vector field in <m>\R^2</m>,
      the <m>F_3\, dz</m> term is
      omitted.) As a concrete example,
      if <m>\vF(x,y,z) = \langle
      x^2y,z^3,x\cos(z)\rangle</m> and <m>C</m> is some oriented curve in <m>\R^3</m>,
      then
      <me>
        \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_C x^2y\, dx + z^3\, dy + x\cos(z)\, dz
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to recognize that the integral on the right-hand side
      is still a line integral and must be evaluated using techniques for
      evaluating line integrals.
      We cannot simply try to treat it as if it
      were a definite integral of a function of one variable.

    <title>Independence of Parameterization</title>
    <p>
      Up to this point, we've just been choosing whatever parameterization
      of an oriented curve <m>C</m> came to mind,
      and our argument for how we can
      use parameterizations to calculate line integrals did not depend on
      the specific choice of parameterization.
      However, it is not
      immediately obvious that different parameterizations don't result in
      different values of the line integral.
      Our next example explores this question.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_12_3_param-indep">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>\vF = x\vi</m>.
          Let us consider two
          different oriented curves from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m>.
          The first
          oriented curve <m>C</m> travels horizontally to <m>(3,1)</m> and then proceeds
          vertically to <m>(3,3)</m>.
          The second oriented curve <m>C_3</m> is the line
          segment from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m>.
          Notice that, as depicted in
          <xref ref="F_12_3_x-field-triangle">Figure</xref>,
          we can break <m>C</m> up into two
          oriented curves <m>C_1</m>
          (the horizontal portion)
          and <m>C_2</m> (the
          vertical portion) so that <m>C = C_1 + C_2</m>.
        </p>

          <caption>The vector field <m>\vF = x\vi</m> and some oriented curves.</caption>
          <image source="images/fig_12_3_field_triangle_rev"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We first note that since <m>\vF</m> is orthogonal to <m>C_2</m>,
          <m>\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr=0</m>;
          threfore <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr =
          \int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.
          We can parameterize <m>C_1</m> as just <m>x\vi+\vj</m>
          for <m>0\leq x\leq 3</m>, which leads to
          <me>
            \int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_0^3\langle x,0\rangle\cdot \langle
            1,0\rangle\, dx = \int_0^3 x\, dx = \frac{9}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 9/2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we look at <m>\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>,
          but we parameterize <m>C_3</m>
          in a bit of a nonstandard way by letting
          <m>\vr(t) = \langle
          3\sin(t),1+2\sin(t)\rangle</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
          Then
          <m>\vr'(t) = \langle 3\cos(t),2\cos(t)\rangle</m>, and
          <me>
            \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_0^{\pi/2}\langle
            3\sin(t),0\rangle\cdot\langle 3\cos(t),2\cos(t)\rangle\, dt =
            \int_0^{\pi/2} 9\sin(t)\cos(t)\, dt = \frac{9}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next activity, you are asked to consider the more typical
          parameterization of <m>C_3</m> and verify that using it gives the same
          value for the line integral.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also worth observing here that <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr =
          \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, so at least two
          (very different)
          paths
          from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m> give the same value of the line integral
          here.
          The next section will further investigate this phenomenon and
          when it happens.

          If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are different paths from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>, it is
          possible for <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> to have a different value to
          <m>\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          Line integrals of vector fields along oriented curves can be
          evaluated by parameterizing the curve in terms of <m>t</m> and then
          calculating the integral of <m>\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)</m> on the
          interval <m>[a,b]</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          The line integral <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> can also be written as
          <m>\int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy</m> if <m>\vF = \langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> is a
          vector field in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\int_C F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy + F_3\, dz</m> if
          <m>\vF = \langle F_1,F_2,F_3\rangle</m> is a vector field in <m>\R^3</m>.
