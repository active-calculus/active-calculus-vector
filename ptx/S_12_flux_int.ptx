    Recall from 11.6, we can give parameterizations of surfaces. for instance <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle 2\cos(t)\sin(s), 2\sin(t)\sin(s),2\cos(s)\rangle</m> as <m>0\leq t\leq 2 \pi</m> and <m>0\leq s\leq \pi</m> parameterizes a sphere centered at the origin of radius 2.

      In section 11.6.2, we talked about how to set up a Riemann sum for hte surface area of a curved surface in space based on a parameterization.

      Need to construct a 3D version of Figure 11.6.6.

        This activity will be about a deeper understanding of the parameterization of a surface.

          In summary, which of the vectors is tangent to the surface and which is orthogonal to the surface?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>
  </exploration>
  <p>
    The formula for surface area in section 11.6 utilized the magnitude of r_x cross r_t to give the surface area element that we summed.

    The direction of r_s cross r_t be orthogonal to the surface traced by the parameterization. this will be a very useful tool in looking at it means to go through a surface. 

    In this way the vector properties (direction and magnitude) of r_s cross r_t will be vital as we explore how much of a vector field moves through a surface.

  <title>The flux of a vector field through a surface</title>
  <p>
    Show a vector field on a grid over a surface.

    If we are trying to measure the amount of the vector field that goes through our surface, we only need to consdier the vector field that goes perpendicular to the surface. Any part of the vector field that goes along the surface will not contribute to flow of the vector field through the surface. We want to pull out the component of the vector field that is tangent to the surface.

    Show the same vector field with the normal and tangential components.

    We want to accumulate the yellow component of the vector field in above picture. 

    make a pictoral argument about outward pointing normal being what positive flow means.

    <title>Visualizing Flux through a field</title>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            show interact with vector field and a surface (surface should have outward pointing normal). allow a selector to change the vector field and change the surface. ask the student to assess whether the flux through different combinations will be positive, negative, or zero.

            this should have clear pictures but variety of answers.

    Let N be the unit vector normal to the surface. The projection of F onto N will be the amount of the vector field that flows through the surface. We need to look at the accumulation of F dot N, since N is unit vector.

    From our ideas above, N can be given by r_s cross r_t divided by magnitude. so we have a way to find F dot N on each block of the sum for the surface area. 

    Our Riemann sum becomes Sum F dot N S_ij where Sij is the area of the ij partition element.

    take limit as partition elements go to zero in all dimensions to get flux integral.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        flux integral can be computed as double integral of F dot (r_s \cross r_t) ds dt. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

    Might want to mention that surface area is \iint 1 dS. 

    Talk about how the cancelation of magnitudes happens in this formula.
