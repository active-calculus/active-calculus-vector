      Need to go over the idea of a simply connnected region and what the boundary of a region means.

      Simple closed paths in the plane are the same as simply connected regions. Show some examples of each and some examples that are not simple or closed. Maybe this goes after the preview activity?

          We will be examining how the circulation around paths that join each other can be combined.

      </introduction>
        <task>
          <p>
            For this part, look at the squares in <xref ref="Greens_Thm_task1_squares">Figure</xref>. All paths are going to the right or up. Will probably want to color coordinate the figure to make it easy to see. Perhaps we just show the 1463 square and compute the paths that are taken to find circulation (remind them that circulation is measured counterclockwise)
          </p>
          
        </task>
    </activity>
    <p>
      Moral of the story: When we sum circulation around adjoining paths only the outer parts survive. In this way, we can both combine circulations and equivalently split into paths around smaller areas.

      There was nothing special about squares in the precediing activity. Could just have easily been done on the following figure.

      <title>Green's Theorerm</title>
    <theorem >
      <p>
      Put the right theorem here...
      <me>
        \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt
      </me>.
      </p>
    </theorem>
    <p>If we have a problem that fits the conditions of Green's Theorem, the we can trade the following problems:
    <ol>
      <li>Calculate the circulation over a closed simple path in the plane </li>
      <li>Integrate the circulation density over the interior of the closed, simple path</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

        <title>Checking Green's Theorem</title>
        <task >
          <p>
            give scenario and verify that the path is a simple closed path (maybe draw a picture of the path and shade the interior of the path). Perhaps the path should be three line segments that make a triangle, that way the line integral is tedious but possible and the area integral is noticably easier (i.e. the students see the advantage of the trade in Green's Theorem)
          </p>
        </task>
        
    </activity>
    <p>
      maybe mention that rarely will you be able to use Green's Theorem to trade a double integral for circulation integral in a useful way since we have to go from a scalar function to two component functions of the vector fields (as an integrand). No canonical way to do this.
