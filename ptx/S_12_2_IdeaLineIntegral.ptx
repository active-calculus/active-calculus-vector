            What is a line integral of a vector-valued function along a curve?

        <li>
          <p>
            How can we estimate if a line integral of a vector-valued
            function along a curve is positive, negative, or zero?

    <p>
      As we discussed in <xref ref="S_12_1_VectorFields">section</xref>,
      vector fields
      are often useful as representations of forces such as gravity, wind,
      and flowing water.
      We learned in <xref ref="S_9_3_Dot_Product">section</xref> that
      the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us
      how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail of
      its displacement vector to the tip.
      However, things more complicated
      when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force
      is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.
      For
      example, how much work does a wind of <m>30</m> mph toward the northwest do
      on an airplane that's flying 500 miles due north?
      What if the wind
      gets weaker the farther north the plane gets?
      In this
      section, we begin investigating how integration can be used to
      calculate the work a force field does in such circumstances.

    <exploration xml:id="PA_12_2">

        Recall from <xref ref="S_9_3_Dot_Product">Section</xref> that the work done by a
        force <m>\vF</m> on an object that moves with displacement vector <m>\vv</m> is
        <m>\vF\cdot \vv</m>.
        In this Preview Activity, we will consider the work
        done by a wind blowing due east at <m>45</m> miles per hour on an airplane
        at various stages of its journey.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              A pilot flies for an hour and finds that he is <m>300</m> miles from
              where he started at a heading of <m>20^\circ</m> degrees east of due
              north.
              Find the work the wind has done on the airplane during the
              flight.

              An hour later,
              the pilot determines that he is <m>275</m> miles due
              north of where he previously checked his position.
              Find the work
              done by the wind on the airplane during the second hour of the
              flight.

            <p>
              Find the pilot's displacement from his original position after
              two hours of flying and use that to find the work done by the wind
              on the airplane during the first two hours of flight.

    <title>Orientations of Curves</title>
    <p>
      Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does
      on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern
      ourselves with <em>how</em> the object moves.
      In particular, in many
      circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point
      <m>(0,1)</m> to the point <m>(4,3)</m> by first going up the <m>y</m>-axis to <m>(0,3)</m>
      and then moving horizontally to <m>(4,3)</m> than if the object moves along
      the line segment from <m>(0,1)</m> directly to <m>(4,3)</m>.
      Similarly, given a
      fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in
      fact, opposite) if the object moves from <m>(4,3)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> directly
      along a line segment.
      We say that a curve in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m> is
      <em>oriented</em> if we have specified the direction of travel along the
      curve.
      When a curve is given parametrically
      (including as a
      vector-valued function),
      our convention will be that the orientation
      follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.

    <title>Line Integrals</title>
    <p>
      Just as when we differentiated a vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> to
      find a tangent vector,
      we begin by dividing a curve <m>C</m> oriented from
      a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> into <m>n</m> small,
      straight pieces.
      Each of
      these pieces is in an area where the vector field <m>\vF</m> is nearly
      constant.
      In <xref ref="fig_12_2_curve-vectors">Figure</xref>, we show this
      situation.
      Each <m>\vr_i</m> is the tip of a vector that traces out the
      curve, and then the <m>\Delta\vr_i = \vr_{i+1}-\vr_i</m> (shown in blue)
      approximate the curve <m>C</m>.
      The green vectors are the vectors in the
      vector field <m>\vF</m> at each of the designated points along the curve.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_12_2_curve-vectors">
      <caption>A curve <m>C</m> oriented from the point <m>P</m> to the point
      <m>Q</m>. The tips of the vectors <m>\vr_i</m> that trace out the curve are
      shown as points. The blue vectors are the <m>\Delta\vr_i</m>, while the
      green vectors are the vectors associated to each of the points by a
      vector field <m>\vF</m>.</caption>
      <image width="45%" source="images/fig_12_2_curve_vec_field" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we are trying to figure out how much a wind current helps or
      hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then
      calculating the dot product <m>\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i</m> makes sense for
      the local amount of help/hindrance,
      as if the vector <m>\vr_i</m> along the
      curve and the force field vector <m>\vF(\vr_i)</m> point in similar
      directions, the dot product will be positive.<fn>
      We are abusing
      notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of <m>\vF</m> is
      points in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>,
      and <m>\vr_i</m> is a vector.
      By <m>\vF(\vr)</m>,
      we mean <m>\vF(r_1,r_2)</m>, where <m>\vr= \langle r_1,r_2\rangle</m>.
      </fn> On the other hand, if
      the angle between them is obtuse,
      the dot product will be negative and
      we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's
      progress.
      Taking the sum over <m>i=0,\dots,n-1</m>, we have a Riemann sum
      that approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft as
      it flies along <m>C</m>:
      <me>
        \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta \vr_i
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This suggests the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_12_2_line-integral">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>C</m> be an oriented curve and
          <m>\vF</m> a vector field defined in a region containing <m>C</m>.
          The
          <term>line integral</term><idx><h>lineintegral</h><h>definition</h></idx> of <m>\vF</m>
          along <m>C</m> is
          <me>
            \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \lim_{|\Delta\vr_i|\to 0}
            \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta\vr_i
          </me>,
          provided the limit exists.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The limit in <xref ref="def_12_2_line-integral">definition</xref> exists provided
      that <m>\vF</m> is a continuous vector field,
      by which we mean that each
      component function of <m>\vF</m> is continuous as a function of <m>2</m> or <m>3</m>
      variables, and that <m>C</m> is a piecewise smooth curved traced out from
      its initial point to its terminal point without retracing any portion
      of the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral
      <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> can each be viewed as the work done by <m>\vF</m> as
      an object moves along the
      (very small)
      vector <m>\Delta\vr</m>, the line
      integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object
      that moves along <m>C</m>
      (in the direction of its orientation).

    <p>
      The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to
      calculate line integrals, since the limit in the definition,
      just like
      the limit in the definition of every other type of integral we've
      studied so far, is cumbersome to work with in most cases.
      However, in
      the case where the oriented curve <m>C</m> is composed of horizontal and
      vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a
      single-variable integral, as the following example shows.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_12_2_line-int">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the constant vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle
          2,1\rangle</m>.
          Let <m>C</m> be the curve that follows the horizontal line
          segment from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(4,1)</m> and then continues down the vertical
          line segment to <m>(4,-2)</m>.
          <xref ref="fig_12_2_curve-field">Figure</xref> shows
          <m>\vF</m> and <m>C</m>, including the orientation.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig_12_2_curve-field">
          <caption>An oriented curve from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(4,-2)</m> in a vector
          field <m>\vF</m>.</caption>
          <image width="45%" source="images/fig_12_2_field_line_segs" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          To calculate <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m>,
          we'll start by working with the
          horizontal line segment.
          Along that part of <m>C</m>, notice that
          <m>d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta x\vi</m>.
          Thus, the Riemann sum that
          calculates the line integral along this portion of <m>C</m> consists of
          terms of the form <m>\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
          x</m>.
          Along this part of <m>C</m>,
          <m>x</m> ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>4</m>, and thus we
          can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral <m>\int_1^4 2\,
          dx = 6</m>.
          Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that
          agrees with the orientation of <m>C</m>,
          we are not surprised to have a
          positive value here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of <m>C</m>.
          Here <m>d\vr
          \approx \Delta\vr = \Delta y\vj</m>,
          which means that <m>\vF\cdot
          d\vr\approx 1\Delta y</m>.
          Hence, our Riemann sum can
          be calculated by the definite integral <m>\int_1^{-2} 1\, dy =
          -3</m>.
          Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match
          the orientation of <m>C</m>.
          Also, the negative value should not be
          unexpected, since <m>C</m> is oriented in a direction for which the vectors
          of <m>\vF</m> point in a direction that would hinder motion along <m>C</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Combining these two pieces of work,
          we find that <m>\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr
          = 6 - 3 = 3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

  <subsection>
    <title>Properties of Line Integrals</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex_12_2_line-int">Example</xref>,
      we implicitly made use of the idea
      that if <m>C</m> can be broken up into two curves <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> such that
      the endpoint of <m>C_1</m> is the start point of <m>C_2</m>,
      then the line
      integral of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C</m> is the sum of the line integrals of <m>\vF</m>
      along <m>C_1</m> and along <m>C_2</m>.
      This probably seems natural, based on the
      property for definite integrals which tells us that
      <me>
        \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = \int_a^c f(x)\, dx + \int_c^b f(x)\, dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The table below summarizes some other properties of line integrals,
      each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of
      definite integrals.
      If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m>
      from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>, we
      denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m> that follows
      <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.
      Also, if <m>C</m> is an
      oriented curve,
      <m>-C</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite
      orientation.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a constant scalar <m>k</m>,
      vector fields <m>\vF</m> and <m>\vG</m>, and
      oriented curves <m>C</m>,
      <m>C_1</m>, and <m>C_2</m>, the following properties hold:

    <title>The Circulation of a Vector Field</title>
    <p>
      If an oriented curve <m>C</m> ends at the same point where it started, we
      say that <m>C</m> is <em>closed</em>.
      The line integral of a vector field
      <m>\vF</m> along a closed curve <m>C</m> is called the <em>circulation</em> of
      <m>\vF</m> around <m>C</m>.
      To emphasize the fact that <m>C</m> is closed, we
      sometimes write <m>\oint_C \vF\cdot d\vr</m> for <m>\int_C \vF\cdot
      d\vr</m>.
      Circulation servies as a measure of a vector field's tendency
      to rotate in a manner consistent with the orientation of the curve.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A line integral measures of a vector field along an oriented
          curve measures the extent to which the vector field points in a
          direction consistent with the orientation of the curve.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Line integrals are defined using Riemann sums by breaking the
          curve into many small segments along which the vector field is
          essentially constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Line integrals have many properties that are analogous to those
          of definite integrals of functions of a single variable.
