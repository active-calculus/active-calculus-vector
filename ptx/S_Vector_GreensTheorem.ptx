  <introduction>
    <p>
      We know from <xref ref="S_Vector_FTCLI"  /> that
      a vector field is path-independent if and only if the
      circulation around every closed curve in its domain is
      <m>0</m>. It is probably not surprising that, given the
      multitude of names we have for path-independent vector fields,
      they are important vector fields that arise frequently. However,
      not every vector field is path-independent, and many times we
      will want to calculate the circulation around a closed curve in
      a vector field that is not path-independent. This section
      explores a connection between line integrals and double
      integrals that you may find surprising.

  <subsection xml:id="SS_Vector_GreensTheorem_Circulation">
    <title>Circulation</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_Vector_GreensTheorem" />, you integrated the
      circulation density of a smooth vector field over a disk and
      found the result was equal to the circulation of
      the vector field along the region's circular boundary. This
      relationship is the theme of this section. To see why this would
      make sense, consider the region <m>R</m> bounded by the curve
      <m>C</m> shown in <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_cartoon" 
      />. We have placed a square grid inside <m>R</m> to suggest the
      idea of breaking <m>R</m> up into many smaller regions, most of
      which are square. This idea should make you think of the methods
      we have already seen of breaking up a region into smaller and
      smaller regions for Riemann sums.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_cartoon">
      <caption>A region bounded by a curve</caption>
      <image source="images/fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_cartoon" width="80%">
	<description>A bean-shaped region in the plane that is bounded
	by a closed curve. The curve is oriented so that when walking
	along the curve, the region is always on the left. There is a
	square grid dividing the up the interior of the region.</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The critical idea here is that if we integrate the circulation
      <em>density</em> over each of the small regions and add those
      up, this is the same as integrating the circulation density over
      the entirety of the region <m>R</m> because of the fundamental
      properties of integrals. Also, integrating circulation <em>per
      unit area</em> over a two-dimensional region should be related
      to the total circulation on that region. Now look at <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_squares" 
      /> and think of these four square regions as being four of the
      square regions inside <m>R</m> in <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_cartoon"
      />.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_squares">
      <caption>A square region divided into four smaller squares</caption>
      <image source="images/fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_squares" width="40%">
	<description>A square region in the plane that is bounded
	by a closed curve oriented counterclockwise. The square is
	divided into four squares of equal size, which are labelled as
	<m>R_1</m>, <m>R_2</m>, <m>R_3</m>, and <m>R_4</m>. There are
	circular arrows inside each of the smaller regions indicating
	counterclockwise orientations.</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We orient the boundary <m>C_i</m> of square region <m>R_i</m> in
      the manner suggested by the circular arrows. This means that the
      vertical boundary in common between <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> is
      oriented <em>up</em> when we calculate the line integral
      <m>\oint_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> and oriented <em>down</em> when
      we evaluate <m>\oint_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. Thus, this line
      segment does not contribute to the sum
      <m>\oint_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr + \oint_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. The
      same idea applies to the other three interior line segments so
      that
      <me>\oint_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr + \oint_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr +
      \oint_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr + \oint_{C_4}\vF\cdot d\vr</me>
      is equal to the line integral of <m>\vF</m> along the boundary
      of the large square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to <xref ref="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_cartoon"
       />, if we find the circulation along the
      boundary of each of the smaller regions, the line integrals
      along the boundaries that lie inside the region <m>R</m> will
      all offset. Thus the value should equal <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot
      d\vr</m>. If we make our grid fine enough, all of the smaller
      regions into which <m>R</m> is divided will be very close to
      rectangular. Our next activity looks at the relationship between
      the circulation along a rectangular curve with sides parallel to
      the coordinate axes and the double integral of the circulation
      density over the rectangular region inside the curve.

	  Now we can see that our result in <xref

	  a coincidence and integrating the circulation
	  <em>density</em> of a smooth vector field on a rectangular
	  region gives the same result as calculating the circulation
	  along the boundary of the region.

      The phenomenon we verified for rectangular regions in <xref

      is a more general result that will be the subject of our next

    <title>Green's Theorem</title>
    <p>So far in this section, we have restricted ourselves to
    relatively nice closed curves when thinking about
    circulation. While the main theorem of this section will not allow
    us to consider arbitrary closed curves, it does cover more varied
    curves than we have discussed so far. A <term>simple closed
    curve</term> is a closed curve that does not cross itself, and
    these are the curves to which our next theorem applies.</p>

	Green's Theorem

      <statement>
	<p>Let <m>C</m> be a simple closed curve in the plane that
	bounds a region <m>R</m> with <m>C</m> oriented in such a
	way that when walking along <m>C</m> in the direction of its
	orientation, the region <m>R</m> is on our left. Suppose that
	<m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> is vector field with continuous partial derivatives
	on the region <m>R</m> and its boundary <m>C</m>. The
	circulation of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C</m> may be calculated as
	<me>\oint_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \iint_R \left(\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} -
	\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}\right)\, dA</me>.</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="act_Vector_GreensTheorem_rectangle"
       />, we showed that <xref ref="thm_Green"
      text="title" /> holds when the region <m>R</m> is a rectangle
      with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The discussion that
      introduced the previous subsection may have you convinced that
      <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" /> holds in its full
      form. Although our argument there was not a rigorous proof, we
      will not say more about why this theorem is true in full
      generality.  <!--TODO In
      <xref ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_ParamRect" 
      />, we will examine how a change of coordinates can give us a
      proof for regions that can be parameterized by rectangles.-->
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At first glance, it may seem that <xref ref="thm_Green"
      text="title" /> is of purely intellectual interest. However, we
      have already encountered situations where parameterizing a curve
      can be complicated. This is particularly true when the curve has
      <q>corners</q> that require us to give separate
      parameterizations for several pieces of the curve, such as with
      the rectangular curve pictured in <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_Rectangle" />. However, as with
      this rectangle, is often the case that a curve that is difficult
      to parameterize bounds a region that is not too complex to
      describe using rectangular or polar coordinates. For instance,
      the rectangular region in <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_Rectangle" /> can be described as
      <m>1\leq x\leq 4</m> and <m>2\leq y\leq 4</m>, rather than
      parameterizing each of the four sides of the rectangle
      separately. Additionally, the integrand of the double integral
      in <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" /> involves partial
      derivatives that can sometimes result in an integrand that is
      very easy to work with. The purpose of <xref ref="thm_Green"
      text="title" /> is, at its core, to allow you to exchange one
      type of integration problem (a line integral) for another type
      of integration problem (a double integral). This will be a
      recurring theme as this chapter continues.

      Generally, <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> is useful for

      <m>\partial F_2/\partial x - \partial F_1/\partial y</m> is
      equal to the integrand in the double integral can be
      difficult. However, the exercises will explore some situations

    <title>What happens when vector fields are not smooth?</title>

      Notice that the assumptions in <xref ref="thm_Green"

	  The types of regions in <m>\R^2</m> to which <xref

	  <term>simply connected regions</term>. To be precise, a
	  simply connected region <m>D</m> in <m>\R^2</m> is a set so
	  that there is a path between every pair of points in
	  <m>D</m> that stays inside <m>D</m> and any simple closed
	  curve in <m>D</m> can be shrunk to a point while remaining
	  inside <m>D</m>. We can think of a simply connected region
	  as being a region that does not have any <q>holes</q>. There
	  are many instances where we can find a way to apply <xref
