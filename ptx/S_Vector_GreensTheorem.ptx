  <introduction>
    <p>
      We know from <xref ref="S_12_4_FTCLI" text="type-global" /> that
      a vector field is path-independent if and only if the
      ciruclation around every closed curve in its domain is
      <m>0</m>. It is probably not surprising that, given the
      multitude of names we have for path-independent vector fields,
      they are important vector fields that arise frequently. However,
      not every vector field is path-independent, and many times we
      will want to calculate the circulation around a closed curve in
      a vector field that is not path-independent. This section
      explores a connection between line integrals and double
      integrals that you may find surprising.

	Green's Theorem
      </title>
      <statement>
	<p>Let <m>C</m> be a simple, closed curve in the plane that
	bounds a region <m>R</m> with <m>C</m> oriented in such a
	way that when walking along <m>C</m> in the direction of its
	orientation, the region <m>R</m> is on our left. Suppose that
	<m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> is vector field with continuous partial derivatives
	on the region <m>R</m> and its boundary <m>C</m>. The
	circulation of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C</m> may be calculated as

    <p>
      At first glance, it may seem that <xref ref="thm_Green"
      text="title" /> is of purely intellectual interest. However, we
      have already encountered a number of instances where
      parameterizing a curve can be complicated. This is particularly
      true when the curve has <q>corners</q> that require us to give
      separate parameterizations for several pieces of the
      curve. However, it is often the case that a curve that is
      difficult to parameterize bounds a region that is not too
      complex to describe using rectangular or polar coordinates. For
      instance, if <m>C</m> is the square with vertices <m>(0,0)</m>,
      <m>(2,0)</m>, <m>(2,2)</m>, and <m>(0,2)</m>, a reasonable
      parameterization involves four line segments. However, the
      region inside <m>C</m> can be described using the inequalities
      <m>0\leq x\leq 2</m> and <m>0\leq y\leq 2</m>. Additionally, the
      integrand of the double integral in <xref ref="thm_Green"
      text="title" /> involves partial derivatives that can sometimes
      result in an integrand that is very easy to work with. The next
      activity asks you to apply <xref ref="thm_Green"
      text="title" /> in a few instances.

    <title>Gradient Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      Without using the terminology,
      we've actually already encountered one
      very important family of vector fields a number of times.
      Given a function <m>f</m> of two or three variables, the gradient of
      <m>f</m> is a vector field, since for any point where <m>f</m> has first-order
      partial derivatives, <m>\nabla f</m> assigns a vector to that point.
