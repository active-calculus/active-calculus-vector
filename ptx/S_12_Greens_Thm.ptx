            What does simply connected region mean and what conditions on a path in the <m>xy</m>-plane will define a simply connected region?

            What is Green's Theorem and how does it help calculate circulation density for simple closed paths in the plane?

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Need to go over the idea of a simply connnected region and what the boundary of a region means.

      Simple closed paths in the plane are the same as simply connected regions. Show some examples of each and some examples that are not simple or closed. Maybe this goes after the preview activity?

          We will be examining how the circulation around paths that join each other can be combined.

            For this part, look at the squares in <xref ref="Greens_Thm_task1_squares">Figure</xref>. All paths are going to the right or up. Will probably want to color coordinate the figure to make it easy to see. Perhaps we just show the 1463 square and compute the paths that are taken to find circulation (remind them that circulation is measured counterclockwise)

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Write out the paths that you would need to take to compute the circulation around the boundary of the bottom left square. Remember that -C_1 will travel edge C_1 from right to left and C_1 will travel edge C_1 from left to right.</p>

                Explain why the sum of the line integrals of a vector field <m>\vF</m> over the paths C_1 and -C_1 will be zero.

              <li>
                Add the circulations for your four smaller squares and simplify the result using the idea in the previous part
              </li>
              <li>
                Compare your simplified answer to the previous part to the circulation of the big square. Explain what you notice
              </li>
            </ol>
        </task>
    </activity>
    <p>
      Moral of the story: When we sum circulation around adjoining paths only the outer parts survive. In this way, we can both combine circulations and equivalently split into paths around smaller areas.

      There was nothing special about squares in the precediing activity. Could just have easily been done on the following figure.

      <title>The idea behind Green's Theorerm</title>
    <p>
      The moral means that we can trade circulation on closed simple paths for sum of the circulations on peices that will make up the interior of the closed simple path. Emphasize that the interior only makes sense for a closed simple path.

      Maybe we have a handwaving development here where we progress like 
      <me>
      \int_C \vF\cdot d\vr  = \sum_i \int_{C_i} \vF\cdot\vr \verb"where the sum of the C_i is C"\\
                           = \sum_i \verb"Circulation Density inside C_i" \Delta A_i \\
                           =\lim_{\Delta A_i \rightarrow 0} \sum_i \verb"Circulation Density inside C_i" \Delta A_i \\
                           =\iint_{A_i} (\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}) dA
    </me>

    If we have a problem that fits the conditions of Green's Theorem, the we can trade the following problems:
    <ol>
      <li>Calculate the circulation over a closed simple path in the plane </li>
      <li>Integrate the circulation density over the interior of the closed, simple path</li>
    </ol>
    <activity xml:id="verify_Greens_Thm">
        <title>Checking Green's Theorem</title>
        <task xml:id="verify_Greens_Thm_task1">
          <p>
            give scenario and verify that the path is a simple closed path (maybe draw a picture of the path and shade the interior of the path). Perhaps the path should be three line segments that make a triangle, that way the line integral is tedious but possible and the area integral is noticably easier (i.e. the students see the advantage of the trade in Green's Theorem)
          </p>
        </task>
        <task xml:id="verify_Greens_Thm_task2">
          <p>
            Set up and evaluate the line integral to calculate the circulation directly

        <task xml:id="verify_Greens_Thm_task3">
          <p>
            Give inequalities in terms of x and y that describe the interior of our path.

        </task>
        <task xml:id="verify_Greens_Thm_task4">
          <p>
           Use the previous part to set up and evaluate the right side of Green's Theorem.
          </p>
        </task>
        <task xml:id="verify_Greens_Thm_task5">
          <p>
            Verify that both the line integrals of the circulation and the double integral of the circulation density give same result.
          </p>
        </task>
    </activity>
    <p>
      maybe mention that rarely will you be able to use Green's Theorem to trade a double integral for circulation integral in a useful way since we have to go from a scalar function to two component functions of the vector fields (as an integrand). No canonical way to do this.
