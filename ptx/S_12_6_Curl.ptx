      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
          Characterize the vector fields <m>\vF</m> for which <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> has the same value for every oriented path from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Understand what special properties gradient vector fields have and how to calculate the potential function, when appropriate.

    <p>
      As we saw in <xref ref="S_12_1_VectorFields">Section</xref>, there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is  "Where exactly is the vector field created?" With the vector field in <xref ref="fig_test">Figure</xref>, you can see that the vector field increases in strength as you move along the flow. So we wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.
