<introduction>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_12_5_Div">Section</xref> we examined two (and higher) dimensional vector field for how the strength of the vector field changed in different regions. In particular, we developed the <xref ref="Div_defn">divergence (Definition</xref>) of a vector field as a local (or density) measurement for how the strength of the vector field changes.

    In this section we will investigate the conditions on which we can trade a flux integral problem for a volume integral.

    Should talk about what a simple boundaryless surface (in space) is and how this is necessary for describing a volume of space.

    While the surface does not have a boundary (no edge where the surface stops), the closed surface will be the boundary for a volume of space. Show a sphere as example of closed surface. Maybe pictures of a cylinder with top and bottom as closed versus just the cylinder (as a surface with TWO boundary parts).

  <title>Measuring the Flux through a Closed Surface</title>
  <p>
    Have an activity that describes how the net flux through a closed surface will tell us how much of the vector field is created or destroyed on the interior.

    Step 1) Show a sphere with the top half shown in red and the bottom in grey with a sample outward pointing normal vector. If the flux through the top surface of a poisonous gas is 15 and the flux through the bottom is -3, Is there poisonous gas being produced inside the sphere? Why?

    Step 2) We subdivide our sphere into a top half and a bottom half using a disk. The flux of the poisonous gas through the disk, with upward pointing normal, is 20. What is the flux through the bottom hemisphere (including the equitorial disk)? Does this give evidence that the bottom hemisphere is emitting or absorbing poisonous gas?

    Step 3) What is the flux through the top hemisphere (including the equitorial disk)? Does this give evidence that the bottom hemisphere is emitting or absorbing poisonous gas?

    Step 4) Show that the sum of the flux through the bottom hemisphere and the flux through the top hemisphere is the same as your flux in step 1).
  </p>
  <p>
    Moral of the activity: The flux through a closed surface can be subdivided into the flux through surfaces which add to the closed surface (with orientaiton switches corresponding to additive inverse). The net flux through a closed surface tells you how much of the vector field is created or destroyed for the interior.

    Remind the reader that the divergence was constructed to measure the density with which the strength of vector field is changing. In 3D, the divergence measures the volume density in which the vector field is being created.

    If we integrate the divergence of a vector field over a compact region of R^3, the result should be the same as the flux of the vector field through the boundary of the compact region.

    Should we have a subsection at the end of each section that shows how to do the relevent graphs and computations in Sage or Calcplot3d?
