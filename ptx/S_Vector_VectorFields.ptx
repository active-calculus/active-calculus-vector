  <introduction>
    <p>
      Thus far vectors have played a central role in our study of
      multivariable calculus.  We know how to do operations on vectors
      (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we
      have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in
      <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>.  The examples of using vectors to
      describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued
      function.  That is, a curve <m>\vr(t)</m> is a function
      that takes as input a real number and produces a vector in
      <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>.  In this section, we will expand our
      understanding of vector-valued functions to take as input a
      point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> or a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> in
      <m>\R^3</m> and produce a vector (typically in <m>\R^2</m> or
      <m>\R^3</m>, respectively).

        <introduction>
        <p>
        It's common for weather forecasters to discuss the wind <term>speed</term>,
        but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know,
        this nomenclature is imprecise.
        It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing
	at <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo"/><per
	base="hour" /></quantity> without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing.
        If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing,
        you need to know about the direction as well.
        (Perhaps you are taking off in a hot air balloon and need to know which direction the chase team should head to keep track of you.)
        Because of the swirling nature of wind,
        it makes sense to give the wind <term>velocity</term>
        at every point in a region
        (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).

              Suppose that given a point <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane,
              you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle</m>.
              For example, we'd then know that at the point <m>(1,-1)</m>,
              the wind velocity is <m>\vF(1,-1) = \langle -1,1\rangle</m>.

    <title>Examples of Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      As <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" />
      showed you, a <term>velocity vector field</term> is an example of a scenario
      where associating a vector to each point in a region
      is useful. We denote such a vector field by
      <m>\vF(x,y)</m> or <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m>, where
      the vector associated to the point <m>(x,y)</m> or <m>(x,y,z)</m> is the
      velocity of something at that point.
      Wind velocity is one example, but
      another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid.
      <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_FluidVelocity" /> shows such a velocity vector
      field.
      Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector
      field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors
      were shown.
      This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner,
      which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on

    <p>
      Force fields,
      such as those created by gravity, are also examples of
      vector fields.
      For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on
      objects.
      The force is directed from the center of the object to the
      center of the earth, and its magnitude is determined by the distance
      between the object and the earth.
      An illustration of this vector field
      can be seen in <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_gravity" />,
      where the earth is
      positioned at the origin, but not shown.
      Notice that the vectors get
      shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact
      that the gravitational force is weaker at that distance.

    <p>
      As suggested in the introduction and <xref
      ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" />,
      vector fields can be given by formulas.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector
          field</term><idx><h>vectorfield</h><h>definition</h></idx>
          in <m>2</m>-space is function whose value at a point
          <m>(x,y)</m> is a <m>2</m>-dimensional vector
          <m>\vF(x,y)</m>.  Similarly, in <m>3</m>-space, a vector
          field is a function <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> whose value at the
          point <m>(x,y,z)</m> is a <m>3</m>-dimensional vector.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Since <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> is a vector,
      it has <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>
      components.
      Each of these components is a scalar function of the point
      <m>(x,y,z)</m>, and so we will often write
      <me>
        \vF(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example,
      if <m>\vF(x,y,z) = \langle x^2,xy\sin(z),y^3\rangle</m>, then
      <m>F_1(x,y,z) = x^2</m>, <m>F_2(x,y,z) = xy\sin(z)</m>,
      and <m>F_3(x,y,z) =
      y^3</m>.
      Any time we are considering a vector field <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m>, the
      definitions of functions <m>F_1</m>, <m>F_2</m>,
      and <m>F_3</m> should be assumed in
      this manner. (For a vector field
      <m>\vF(x,y)</m> in <m>2</m>-space, we only have
      the functions <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m>, defined analogously.)
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="SS_Vector_VectorFields_Plotting">
    <title>Plotting Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" />
      gave you a chance to plot some vectors
      in the vector fields <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle</m> and <m>\vG(x,y) =
      \langle 0,-x\rangle</m>.
      It would be impossible to sketch <em>all</em> of
      the vectors in these vector fields,
      since there is one for every point
      in the plane.
      In fact, even sketching by hand many more of the vectors
      than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes
      tedious.
      Fortunately, computer algebra systems can do a great job of
      making such sketches.
      One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the
      magnitudes of the vectors are typically scaled in these plots,
      including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in the
      text.
      To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field
      <m>\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj</m> in <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_scalefield" />.

    <p>
      The left plot shows some of the vectors but accurately depicts all of
      their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand,
      especially along the lines <m>y=x</m> and <m>y=-x</m>.
      The plot on the right,
      however, uses a uniform scaling to make the figure easier to read.
      As
      before, each vector's direction is completely accurate,
      but now the
      magnitudes are much smaller.
      However, the <em>relative</em> magnitudes
      are preserved,
      helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin
      have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.

    <title>Gradient Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      Without using the terminology, we've actually already
      encountered one very important family of vector fields a number
      of times.  Given a function <m>f</m> of two or three variables,
      the gradient of <m>f</m> is a vector field, since for any point
      where <m>f</m> has first-order partial derivatives,
      <m>\grad{f}</m> assigns a vector to that point.

            there are three sets of axes showing level curves for

            Sketch at least six vectors in the gradient vector field

            you should ensure that the relative magnitudes (and

          A <m>2</m>-dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of
          <m>\R^2</m> whose value is a <m>2</m>-dimensional vector.
          A <m>3</m>-dimensional
          vector field is a function defined on part of <m>\R^3</m> whose value is
          a <m>3</m>-dimensional vector.

          Vector fields arise in familiar contexts such as wind velocity,

          Vector fields are generally plotted in ways that ensure the
          direction and relative magnitudes of the vectors sketched are
          correct instead of ensuring that each vector's magnitude is
          depicted correctly.
