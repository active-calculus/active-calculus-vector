    In some of the activities and examples in this chapter (<xref ref="A_12_3_2">Activity</xref>, <xref ref="ex_12_3_param-indep">Example</xref>, and <xref ref="A_12_3_3">Activity</xref>), we have encountered situations where <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are different oriented curves from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. In this section, we explore vector fields which have the property that for all points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, if <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented paths from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>, then <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.

        We've used Clairaut's Theorem to argue that a vector field in
        <m>\R^2</m> is not a gradient vector field when <m>\partial
        F_1/\partial y\neq \partial F_2/\partial x</m>, and earlier in
        this preview activity, you verified that a given vector field
        was the gradient of a particular function of two
        variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of three
        variables. However, in that case there are six mixed partials
        to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious.The remaining
        parts of this preview activity suggest a process for
        determining if a vector field in <m>\R^3</m> is conservative
        as well as finding a potential function for the vector field.

<subsection>
  <title>Path-Independent Vector Fields</title>
  <p>
    We say that a vector field <m>\vF</m> defined on a domain <m>D</m> is <term><em>path-independent</em></term> <idx><h>pathindependent</h><h>definition</h></idx> if <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> whenever <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented paths in <m>D</m> having the same initial point and same terminal point.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="A_12_3_2">Activity</xref> and <xref ref="ex_12_3_param-indep">Example</xref>, we encountered situations where we had evidence that a vector field was path-independent. But since the definition of path-independence requires that we must get the same value for every pair of points in the domain and every possible path from one point to the other, it doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent is an easy task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be shown to be path-independent. Let <m>f\colon \R^3\to \R</m> be a function for which <m>\nabla f</m> is continuous on a domain <m>D</m>. Suppose that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are points in <m>D</m> and let <m>C</m> be a smooth oriented path from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>. Let's take a look at <m>\int_C\nabla f \cdot d\vr</m> by fixing an arbitrary parameterization <m>\vr(t)</m> of <m>C</m>, <m>a\leq t \leq b</m>. Since <m>\nabla f(\vr(t)) = \langle f_x(\vr(t)),f_y(\vr(t)),f_z(\vr(t))\rangle</m>, we know that 
    <me>
      \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr  = \int_a^b \nabla f(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt = \int_a^b \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)), f_z(\vr(t))\rangle \cdot \vr'(t)\, dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t)\rangle</m>, then the integrand above is
    <me>
      \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)), f_z(\vr(t))\rangle\cdot \langle x'(t),y'(t),z'(t)\rangle =\\ 
      f_x\left( x(t),y(t),z(t) \right) x'(t) + f_y \left( x(t),y(t),z(t) \right) y'(t) + f_z \left( x(t),y(t),z(t) \right) z'(t).
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that this is exactly what the chain rule tells us <m>\frac{d}{dt} f(\vr(t))</m> is equal to.
    Therefore,
    <me>
      \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \frac{d}{dt} f(\vr(t))\, dt = f(\vr(b)) - f(\vr(a)) = f(Q) - f(P)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, gradient vector fields are path-independent vector fields, and we can evaluate line integrals of gradient vector fields by using a potential function. (Technically the argument above assumed that <m>C</m> was smooth, but we can replace <m>C</m> by a piecewise smooth curve by splitting the line integral up into the sum of finitely many line integrals along smooth curves.)
  </p>
  <p>
    This result is so important that it is frequently called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, because of its similarity to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which can be written as
    <me>
      \int_a^b f'(x)\, dx = f(b) - f(a)
    </me>.

  <title>Line Integrals Along Closed Curves</title>
  <p>
    Recall that we call an oriented curve <m>C</m> <em>closed</em> if it has the same initial and terminal point. A typical example of a closed curve would be a circle (with an orientation of which way to go around), but we could also consider something like the square with vertices <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(-1,1)</m>, <m>(-1,-1)</m>, and <m>(1,-1)</m>, oriented clockwise (or counterclockwise). Recall that we sometimes use the symbol <m>\oint</m> for a line integral when the curve is closed and that if <m>C=C_1+C_2</m>, then <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr=\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr+ \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.

    From <xref ref="A_12_4_3">Activity</xref>, we now know that <m>\vF</m> is path-independent if and only if <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 0</m> for all closed curves <m>C</m> in the domain of <m>\vF</m>. Although this is not a terribly useful way to show that a vector field is path-independent, it can be a useful way to show that a vector field is <em>not</em> path-independent: find a closed curve around which the circulation is not zero.

  <title>What other vector fields are path-independent?</title>
  <p>
    Recall that in single variable calculus, the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that given a constant <m>c</m> and a continuous function <m>f</m>, there is a unique function <m>A(x)</m> for which <m>A(c) = 0</m> and <m>A'(x) = f(x)</m>. In particular, <m>A(x) = \int_c^x f(t)\, dt</m> is this function. We are about to investigate an analog of this result for path-independent vector fields, but first we require two additional definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>D</m> is a subset of <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>, we say that <m>D</m> is <em>open</em> <idx><h>open</h><h>definition</h></idx> provided that for every point in <m>D</m>, there is a disc (in <m>\R^2</m>) or ball (in <m>\R^3</m>) centered at that point such that every point of the disc/ball is contained in <m>D</m>. For example, the set of points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> for which <m>x^2+y^2 \lt 1</m> is open, since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc contained in the set. However, if we change the inequality to <m>x^2+y^2\leq 1</m>, then the set is not open, as any point on the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside the set, that is with <m>x^2+y^2>1</m>. We will also say that a region <m>D</m> is <em>connected</em><idx><h>connected</h><h>definition</h></idx> provided that for every pair of points in <m>D</m>, there is a path from one to the other contained in <m>D</m>.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, connected region <m>D</m>. We will assume that <m>D</m> is in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\vF</m> is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to <m>\R^3</m>. We want to define a function <m>f</m> on <m>D</m> by using the vector field <m>\vF</m> and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> an arbitrary value. (Setting <m>f(x_0,y_0)=0</m> is probably convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>D</m>, define
        <me>
          f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr
        </me>,
        where <m>C</m> is any oriented path from <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m>. Since <m>D</m> is connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since <m>\vF</m> is
        path-independent, <m>f</m> is well-defined. If different paths from <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m> gave different values for the line integral, then we'd not be sure what <m>f(x,y)</m> really is.
      </p>

    <li><p>
      Conservative or gradient vector fields are path-independent, and if <m>C</m> is an oriented curve from <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> to <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, then 
        <me>
        \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr = f(x_2,y_2)-f(x_1,y_1)
        </me>
        with the analogous result holding if <m>f</m> is a function of three variables.

      <p>
        A vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is <m>0</m>.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If a vector field <m>\vF</m> is path-independent, then there exists a function <m>f</m> such that <m>\nabla f = \vF</m>. That is, <m>\vF</m> is a conservative or gradient vector field.
