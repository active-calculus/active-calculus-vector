            How can we characterize the vector fields <m>\vF</m> for which
            <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> has the same value for every oriented path
            from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m>?

      In some of the activities and examples in this chapter we have
      encountered situations where <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are different oriented curves from a
      point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr =
      \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.
      In this section, we explore vector fields
      which have the property that for all points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
      if <m>C_1</m> and
      <m>C_2</m> are oriented paths from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>,
      then <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot
      d\vr = \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.

        In <xref ref="A_12_3_2">Activity</xref>
        we considered the vector field
        <m>\vF(x,y) =
        \langle y^2,2xy+3\rangle</m> and two different oriented curves from
        <m>(1,0)</m> to <m>(-1,0)</m>.
        We found that the value of the line integral of
        <m>\vF</m> was the same along those two oriented curves.

      <p>
        We've used Clairaut's Theorem to argue that a vector field in <m>\R^2</m>
        is not a gradient vector field when <m>\partial F_1/\partial
        y\neq \partial F_2/\partial x</m>,
        and earlier in this preview activity,
        you verified that a given vector field was the gradient of a
        particular function of two variables.
        Clairaut's Theorem holds for
        functions of three variables.
        However, in that case there are six mixed partials to
        calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious.
        The remaining parts of
        this preview activity suggest a process for determining if a vector
        field in <m>\R^3</m> is conservative as well as finding a potential
        function for the vector field.

              When finding the most general antiderivative for a function of
              one variable, we add a constant of integration
              (usually denoted by
              <m>C</m>)
              to capture the fact that any constant will vanish through
              differentiation.
              When taking the partial derivative with respect to
              <m>x</m> of a function of
              <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>,
              what variables can appear in terms that vanish
              because they are treated as constants?
              What does this tell you
              should be added to <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> in the previous part to make them
              the most general possible functions with the desired partial
              derivatives with respect to <m>x</m>?

                g(x,y,z) = 3xe^{y^2}-z\cos(x)-yz+m_1(z)

              Notice that <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> are
              functions of <m>z</m> alone, so taking a partial derivative with respect
              to <m>z</m> is the same as taking an ordinary derivative,
              and thus you

    <title>Path-Independent Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      We say that a vector field <m>\vF</m> defined on a domain <m>D</m> is
      <em>path-independent</em> <idx><h>pathindependent</h><h>definition</h></idx> if
      <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> whenever <m>C_1</m> and
      <m>C_2</m> are oriented paths in <m>D</m> having the same initial point and same
      terminal point.
    </p>

    <p>
      We've already encountered some situations where we had evidence that a
      vector field was path-independent,
      but since the definition requires
      that for every pair of points in the domain and every possible pair of
      paths from oine point to the other we must get the same value, it
      doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent is an
      easy task.
      Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be
      shown to be path-independent.
      Let <m>f\colon \R^3\to \R</m> be a function
      for which <m>\nabla f</m> is continuous on a domain <m>D</m>.
      Suppose that <m>P</m>
      and <m>Q</m> are points in <m>D</m> and let <m>C</m> be a smooth oriented path from <m>P</m> to
      <m>Q</m>.
      Let's take a look at <m>\int_C\nabla f \cdot d\vr</m> by fixing an arbitrary
      parameterization <m>\vr(t)</m> of <m>C</m>, <m>a\leq t \leq b</m>.
      Since <m>\nabla
      f(\vr(t)) = \langle f_x(\vr(t)),f_y(\vr(t)),f_z(\vr(t))\rangle</m>,
      we know that
      <me>
        \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr  = \int_a^b \nabla f(\vr(t))\cdot
        \vr'(t)\, dt = \int_a^b \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)),
        f_z(\vr(t))\rangle \cdot \vr'(t)\, dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t),
      z(t)\rangle</m>, then the integrand
      above is
      <md>
        \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)), f_z(\vr(t))\rangle\cdot \langle
        x'(t),y'(t),z'(t)\rangle =\\ f_x(x(t),y(t),z(t))x'(t) +
        f_y(x(t),y(t),z(t))y'(t) + f_z(x(t),y(t),z(t))z'(t).
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this is exactly what the chain rule tells us
      <m>\frac{d}{dt} f(\vr(t))</m> is equal to.
      Therefore,
      <me>
        \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \frac{d}{dt} f(\vr(t))\, dt =
        f(\vr(b)) - f(\vr(a)) = f(Q) - f(P)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, gradient vector fields are path-independent vector
      fields, and we can evaluate line integrals of gradient vector fields
      by using a potential function.
      (Technically the argument above assumed
      that <m>C</m> was smooth, but we can replace <m>C</m> by a piecewise smooth
      curve by splitting the line integral up into the sum of finitely many
      line integrals along smooth curves.)
    </p>

    <p>
      This result is so important that it is frequently called the
      Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line integrals, because of its
      similarity to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which can be
      written as
      <me>
        \int_a^b f'(x)\, dx = f(b) - f(a)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line
      Integrals</em> Let <m>f</m> be a function for which <m>\nabla f</m> is
      continuous on a domain <m>D</m>.
      If <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are points in <m>D</m> and
      <m>C</m> is a piece-wise smooth oriented path from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> in <m>D</m>, then
      <me>
        \int_C \nabla f\cdot d\vr = f(Q) - f(P)

    <title>Line Integrals Along Closed Curves</title>
    <p>
      Recall that we call an oriented curve <m>C</m>
      <em>closed</em> if it has
      the same initial and terminal point.
      A typical example of a closed
      curve would be a circle
      (with orientation),
      but we could also consider
      something like the square with vertices <m>(1,1)</m>,
      <m>(-1,1)</m>, <m>(-1,-1)</m>,
      and <m>(1,-1)</m>, oriented clockwise
      (or counterclockwise).

        From the first part of this activity, you now now that the line
        integral around any closed curve in a path-independent vector field is
        <m>0</m>.
        What can we say about the converse?
        That is, suppose that <m>\vF</m>
        is a continuous vector field on a domain <m>D</m> for which
        <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 0</m> for all closed curves <m>C</m>.

      From <xref ref="A_12_4_3">Activity</xref>,
      we now know that <m>\vF</m> is path-independent if and only if <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 0</m> for all closed
      curves <m>C</m> in the domain of <m>\vF</m>.
      Although this is not a terribly
      useful way to show that a vector field is path-independent,
      it can be
      a useful way to show that a vector field is <em>not</em>
      path-independent:
      find a closed curve around which the circulation is
      not zero.

    <title>What other vector fields are path-independent?</title>
    <p>
      Recall that in single variable calculus, the Second Fundamental
      Theorem of Calculus tells us that given a constant <m>c</m> and a
      continuous function <m>f</m>,
      there is a unique function <m>A(x)</m> for which
      <m>A(c) = 0</m> and <m>A'(x) = f(x)</m>.
      In particular, <m>A(x) = \int_c^x f(t)\,
      dt</m> is this function.
      We are about to investigate an analog of this result for
      path-independent vector fields,
      but first we require two additional
      definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>D</m> is a subset of <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>,
      we say that <m>D</m> is
      <em>open</em>
          <idx><h>open</h><h>definition</h></idx>
      provided that for every point in <m>D</m>, there
      is a disc (in <m>\R^2</m>) or ball
      (in <m>\R^3</m>)
      centered at that point such
      that every point of the disc/ball is contained in <m>D</m>.
      For example,
      the set of points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> for which <m>x^2+y^2 \lt 1</m> is open,
      since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc
      contained in the set.
      However, if we change the inequality to
      <m>x^2+y^2\leq 1</m>, then the set is not open,
      as any point on the circle
      <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any
      disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside
      the set, that is with <m>x^2+y^2>1</m>.
      We will also say that a region <m>D</m>
      is <em>connected</em><idx><h>connected</h><h>definition</h></idx> provided that for
      every pair of points in <m>D</m>,
      there is a path from one to the other
      contained in <m>D</m>.
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="A_12_4_5">
      <p>
        Let <m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> be a continuous,
        path-independent vector field on an open,
        connected region <m>D</m>.
        We will assume that <m>D</m> is in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\vF</m>
        is a two-dimensional vector field,
        but the ideas below generalize
        completely to <m>\R^3</m>.
        We want to define a function <m>f</m> on <m>D</m> by
        using the vector field <m>\vF</m> and line integrals, much like the
        Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an
        antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite
        integral.
        To that end, we assign <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> an arbitrary
        value. (Setting <m>f(x_0,y_0)=0</m> is probably convenient,
        but we won't
        explicitly tie our hands.
        Just assume that <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> is defined
        to be some number.) Now for any other point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>D</m>, define
        <me>
          f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr
        </me>,
        where <m>C</m> is any oriented path from <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m>.
        Since
        <m>D</m> is connected, such an oriented path must exist.
        Since <m>\vF</m> is
        path-independent, <m>f</m> is well-defined.
        If different paths from
        <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m> gave
        different values for the line integral,
        then we'd not be sure what
        <m>f(x,y)</m> really is.
      </p>

      <p>
        To better understand this mysterious function <m>f</m> we've now defined,
        let's start looking at its partial derivatives.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>D</m> is open, there is a disc (perhaps very small)
              surrounding <m>(x,y)</m> that is contained in <m>D</m>,
              so fix a point <m>(a,b)</m>
              in that disc.
              Since <m>D</m> is connected, there is a path <m>C_1</m> from
              <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(a,b)</m>.
              Let <m>C_y</m> be the line segment from <m>(a,b)</m>
              to <m>(a,y)</m> and let <m>C_x</m> be the line segment from <m>(a,y)</m> to
              <m>(x,y)</m>.
              (See <xref ref="F_12_4_paths-potential">Figure</xref>.)
              Rewrite <m>f(x,y)</m>
              as a sum of <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> and line
              integrals along <m>C_1</m>, <m>C_y</m>, and <m>C_x</m>.
