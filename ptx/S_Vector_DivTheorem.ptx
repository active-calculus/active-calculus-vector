<introduction>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_Vector_Div" /> we examined vector fields for how
    the strength of a vector field changes in different regions. In
    particular, we developed the <xref ref="defn_Div"
    text="custom">divergence</xref> of a vector field as a local
    measurement (based on density) of how the strength of the vector field changes. In particular, we did this by looking at the flux of the vector field through a closed path in two dimensions, then generalizing these ideas to higher dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt" />, we measured how much of a
    vector field flowed through a section of a surface in three
    dimensions as a generalization of our argument from <xref
    ref="S_Vector_Div" />. In this section, we will connect the ideas
    of flux of a vector field through a closed surface in three
    dimensions and the divergence of that vector field.
  </p>
  <p>
    A surface in three dimensions is said to be <term>closed</term> if
    it has no boundary. Recalling the surfaces we studied in <xref
    ref="S_Vector_StokesThm" /> where we applied <xref
    ref="thm_Stokes" text="title" />, <em>none</em> of those surfaces
    were closed because the boundary of the surface through which we
    calculated the flux was the curve along which we calculated the
    circulation. In <xref ref="fig_Vector_DivThm_NotClosedSurfaces"
    />, we show two surfaces that are <em>not</em> closed, as
    demonstrated by the red curves marking the edge where the surface
    ends.

    Closed surfaces can be used to define the boundary of a volume in
    space. If we have the top and bottom on our cylinder, we have a
    well-defined volume of space, in that we know which points are
    <q>inside</q> the volume and which are <q>outside</q> of the
    volume. With different top and bottom surfaces, the enclosed
    volume would be different. <xref

  <p>
    We will use three different surfaces to examine the flux through
    closed surfaces. Let <m>S_{\text{top}}</m> be the top half of the
    unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in magenta in the figures below). Let
    <m>S_{\text{bottom}}</m> be the bottom half of the unit sphere
    centered at the origin (graphed in yellow). Finally, let
    <m>S_{\text{mid}}</m> be the unit disk centered at the origin in
    the <m>xy</m>-plane (graphed in blue). With these definitions, <m>S_{\text{top}}</m> and <m>S_{\text{bottom}}</m> will make a closed surface given by the unit sphere. The surfaces <m>S_{\text{top}}</m> and <m>S_{\text{mid}}</m> will enclose the top half of the unit ball, while <m>S_{\text{bottom}}</m> and <m>S_{\text{mid}}</m> will enclose the bottom half of the unit ball.

    The preview activity showed how the flux through a closed surface can be subdivided into the flux through surfaces which combine to be the closed surface (with orientation switches corresponding to additive inverse). The net flux through the closed surface measures the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed on the interior of the closed surface.

  <title>The Divergence Theorem</title>
  <p>
    The divergence of a vector field was developed as a measurement of
    the density with which the strength of vector field is
    changing. In three dimensions, the divergence measures the volume density in which the vector field is being created or destroyed. This means that if we integrate the divergence of a vector field over a volume of space, we will get the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed in that particular volume of space. Since the net amount of a vector field that is created or destroyed in a volume of space is the same as the net flux of the vector field through the boundary of that volume (which is a closed surface), we have a correspondence between a triple integral of the divergence of a vector field on the interior of a closed surface and the flux integral of the vector field over the closed surface.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_Div">
    <title>Divergence Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Let <m>S</m> be a closed surface in three dimensional space

  <p>The preview activity and the discussion before the statement of

  some intuition as to why the theorem is true. The ideas should also
  seem similar to the manner in which we approached <xref

  next activity walks you through evaluating both the flux integrals
  necessary to calculate the flux directly and the triple integral of

  <p>We finish this section with an activity that asks you to

        The flux of a smooth vector field through a closed surface can
	be computed by integrating the divergence of the vector field
