	What is the relationship between the circulation of a vector

        Why does the flux integral of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> through a

<introduction>
  <p>
    When we studied <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" /> in <xref
    ref="S_Vector_GreensTheorem" text="type-global" />, we saw how
    integrating the circulation density over a region in the plane
    bounded by a simple closed curve gave an alternative way of
    calculating the circulation along the boundary curve. When we
    consider simple closed curves in <m>\R^3</m>, the
    situation gets more complicated. However, there is an interesting,
    and perhaps surprising, generalization of <xref ref="thm_Green"
    text="title" /> for us to examine.

  <title>Circulation in three dimensions and Stokes' Theorem</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global" />, we saw
    that a simple closed curve in <m>\R^3</m> can bound many different
    surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface
    <m>S</m> in <m>\R^3</m> that has a well-defined normal vector
    <m>\vn</m> at every point and a boundary curve <m>C</m>. We will
    use the normal vector to define an orientation of <m>C</m> so
    that if a person were to walk along <m>C</m> in the direction of
    the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the
    direction of <m>\vn</m>, their left arm would be over the surface
    <m>S</m>. Notice that this is the same convention that we used
    with <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" /> if we assume that the
    normal vector being used is <m>\vk</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <xref ref="fig_Vector_StokesThm_surface_boundary"
    text="type-global" />, we show the curve <m>C</m> from <xref
    ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global" /> in magenta as well
    as a surface <m>S</m> that has <m>C</m> as its boundary. The
    chosen normal vector <m>\vn</m> to <m>S</m> is shown, as is
    the orientation of <m>C</m> that matches <m>\vn</m>.

  <p>Thinking back to <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" />, our main
  idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple
  closed curve in <m>\R^2</m> by taking the double integral of the
  circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw
  in <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global" />, we can break
  up <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> into line integrals around other
  simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented
  oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green's
  Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green's Theorem, we
  require that a simple closed curve <m>C</m> in three
  dimensions bound a smooth surface <m>S</m> with a 
  normal vector <m>\vn</m>. In doing this, we can choose our
  <q>smaller</q> curves similar to the squares we used in Green's
  Theorem to lie on the surface <m>S</m>. This gives us almost all the
  ingredients used in Green's Theorem, but we still need to find a
  suitable replacement for the circulation density.</p>
  
  <p>As we saw in <xref ref="S_Vector_Curl" text="type-global" />, the
  curl of a vector field in <m>\R^3</m> measures the rotation of the
  vector field. <xref ref="thm_Vector_Curl_rot_strength"
  text="type-global" /> says that for a unit vector <m>\vv</m>, the
  scalar <m>(\curl(\vF)(a,b,c))\cdot \vv</m> measures the
  rotational strength of <m>\vF</m> at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m> around
  the axis defined by <m>\vv</m>. When <m>\vv</m> is the normal vector
  to the surface <m>S</m> at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m>, we have the
  appropriate analog for the circulation density of <m>\vF</m> on
  <m>S</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Thus, the equivalent idea to integrating
  the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field over a
  region in the plane is calculating the flux integral <m>\iint_D
  \curl(\vF)\cdot (\vr_s\times \vr_t)\, dA</m>, where <m>\vr(s,t)</m>
  on the domain <m>D</m> gives a parametrization of the smooth
  surface <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>A rigorous proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of
  this text. However, the previous subsection and our discussion of
  <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" /> provide an intuitive
  description of why this theorem is true.</p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Stokes">
    <title>Stokes' Theorem</title>
    <statement>  
      <p>Let <m>S</m> be a smooth surface in <m>\R^3</m> with a simple
      closed curve <m>C</m> as its boundary. Let <m>\vF</m> be a
      vector field that is smooth on <m>S</m> and <m>C</m>. Suppose
      that <m>\vr(s,t)</m> on the domain <m>D</m> gives a
      parametrization of <m>S</m> for which <m>C</m> is oriented so
      that a person walking along <m>C</m> in the direction of its
      orientation and head pointing in the direction of the normal
      vector <m>\vr_s\times \vr_t</m> would have their left hand above
      <m>S</m>. In this setting, the circulation of <m>\vF</m> along
      <m>C</m> is equal to the flux of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> through
      <m>S</m>. That is,
      <me>
	\oint\limits_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \iint\limits_{D} (\curl(\vF))\cdot
	(\vr_s\times\vr_t)\, dA
      </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>When we looked <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title" />, it was
  generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we
  calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the
  circumstances described in exercises <xref
  ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_AreaViaLineInt" text="global" /> and
  <xref ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_centroid" text="global" />, we
  did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line
  integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector
  field. The situation for <xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title" /> will
  be similar, with the exception of <xref
  ref="ez_Vector_StokesThm_potential" text="type-local" /> in this
  section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional
  piece of freedom: selecting the surface <m>S</m> through which we
  calculate the flux of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> from amongst possibly
  several reasonable surfaces with boundary <m>C</m>. The next two
  activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their
  boundary.

            surface (with normal vector) on which the vector field is

  <exercise xml:id="ez_Vector_StokesThm_potential">
    <introduction>
      <p><xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title" /> is generally used to
      turn a line integral into a flux integral. Sometimes it is
      possible to be given a flux integral and recognize that the
      given vector field <m>\vF</m> is <m>\curl(\vG)</m> for some
      vector field <m>\vG</m>, however. When this is the case, we call
      <m>\vG</m> a <term>vector potential</term> for the vector field
      <m>\vF</m>, much like a function <m>f</m> so that <m>\vF =
      \grad(f)</m> is called a potential function for <m>\vF</m>.</p>
