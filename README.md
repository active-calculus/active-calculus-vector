# active-calculus-vector

Vector calculus materials to accompany Active Calculus
Multivariable. At present, we only support building HTML for this,
since preparing the necessary static versions of the interactive
elements for PDF generation requires considerable extra effort and
care. You can view a live HTML version of this at
http://activecalculus.org/vector/.

## Building instructions

1. Run `make acmv-extraction`
1. Run `make html`
1. Find all the relevant files in output/html
