<p>Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern ourselves with <em class="emphasis">how</em> the object moves. In particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point \((0,1)\) to the point \((4,3)\) by first going up the \(y\)-axis to \((0,3)\) and then moving horizontally to \((4,3)\) than if the object moves along the line segment from \((0,1)\) directly to \((4,3)\text{.}\) Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the object moves from \((4,3)\) to \((0,1)\) directly along a line segment. We say that a curve in \(\R^2\) or \(\R^3\) is <em class="emphasis">oriented</em> if we have specified the direction of travel along the curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.</p>
