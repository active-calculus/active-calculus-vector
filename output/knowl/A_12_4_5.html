<p>Let \(\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle\) be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, connected region \(D\text{.}\) We will assume that \(D\) is in \(\R^2\) and \(\vF\) is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to \(\R^3\text{.}\) We want to define a function \(f\) on \(D\) by using the vector field \(\vF\) and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign \(f(x_0,y_0)\) an arbitrary value. (Setting \(f(x_0,y_0)=0\) is probably convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that \(f(x_0,y_0)\) is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point \((x,y)\) in \(D\text{,}\) define</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(C\) is any oriented path from \((x_0,y_0)\) to \((x,y)\text{.}\) Since \(D\) is connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since \(\vF\) is path-independent, \(f\) is well-defined. If different paths from \((x_0,y_0)\) to \((x,y)\) gave different values for the line integral, then we'd not be sure what \(f(x,y)\) really is.</p>
<p>To better understand this mysterious function \(f\) we've now defined, let's start looking at its partial derivatives.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Since \(D\) is open, there is a disc (perhaps very small) surrounding \((x,y)\) that is contained in \(D\text{,}\) so fix a point \((a,b)\) in that disc. Since \(D\) is connected, there is a path \(C_1\) from \((x_0,y_0)\) to \((a,b)\text{.}\) Let \(C_y\) be the line segment from \((a,b)\) to \((a,y)\) and let \(C_x\) be the line segment from \((a,y)\) to \((x,y)\text{.}\) (See <a knowl="./knowl/F_12_4_paths-potential.html" title="Figure 1.4.2">Figure 1.4.2</a>.) Rewrite \(f(x,y)\) as a sum of \(f(x_0,y_0)\) and line integrals along \(C_1\text{,}\) \(C_y\text{,}\) and \(C_x\text{.}\) <figure class="figure-like"><div style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="images/fig_12_4_paths_potential_rev.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div>

<li><p>Notice that we can parameterize \(C_y\) by \(\langle a,t\rangle\) for \(b\leq t\leq y\text{.}\) Find a similar parameterization for \(C_x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the parameterizations from above to write \(\int_{C_y}\vF\cdot d\vr\) and \(\int_{C_x}\vF\cdot d\vr\) as single variable integrals in the manner of <a href="S_12_3_ParamLineIntegrals.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.3: Using Parameterizations to Calculate Line Integrals">Section 1.3</a>. (Recall that \(\vF(x,y) = \langle F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y)\rangle\text{,}\) enabling you to express your integrals in terms of \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) without any dot products.)</p></li>
<li><p>Rewrite your expression for \(f(x,y)\) using the single variable integrals above (and a line integral along \(C_1\)).</p></li>
<li><p>Use your expression for \(f(x,y)\) and the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to calculate \(f_x(x,y)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>To calculate \(f_y(x,y)\text{,}\) we continue to consider a path \(C_1\) from \((x_0,y_0)\) to \((a,b)\text{,}\) but now let \(L_x\) be the line segment from \((a,b)\) to \((x,b)\) and let \(L_y\) be the line segment from \((x,b)\) to \((y,b)\text{.}\) Modify the process you used to find \(f_x(x,y)\) to find \(f_y(x,y)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What can you conclude about the relationship between \(\nabla f\) and \(\vF\text{?}\)</p></li>
