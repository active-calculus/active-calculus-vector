<p>As we discussed in <a href="S_12_1_VectorFields.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.1: Vector Fields">section 1.1</a>, vector fields are often useful as representations of forces such as gravity, wind, and flowing water. We learned in <span>(((Unresolved xref, reference "S_9_3_Dot_Product"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute)))</span><a href="" class="xref" title="">section </a> that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail of its displacement vector to the tip. However, things more complicated when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves. For example, how much work does a wind of \(30\) mph toward the northwest do on an airplane that's flying 500 miles due north? What if the wind gets weaker the farther north the plane gets? In this section, we begin investigating how integration can be used to calculate the work a force field does in such circumstances.</p>
