<p>When finding the most general antiderivative for a function of one variable, we add a constant of integration (usually denoted by \(C\)) to capture the fact that any constant will vanish through differentiation. When taking the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) of a function of \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\text{,}\) what variables can appear in terms that vanish because they are treated as constants? What does this tell you should be added to \(g\) and \(h\) in the previous part to make them the most general possible functions with the desired partial derivatives with respect to \(x\text{?}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_12_4_FTCLI.html#li-79">in-context</a></span>
