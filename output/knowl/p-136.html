<p>Let \(\vG(x,y,z) = \langle 3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x),6xy e^{y^2} -
z,3z^2-y-\cos(x)\rangle\) and \(\vH(x,y,z) = \langle 3x^2 y,x^3+2yz^3,xz+3y^2z^2\rangle\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If \(\vG\) and \(\vH\) are to be gradient vector fields, then there are functions \(g\) and \(h\) for which \(\vG = \nabla g\) and \(\vH=\nabla
h\text{.}\) What would this tell us about the partial derivatives \(g_x\text{,}\) \(g_y\text{,}\) \(g_z\text{,}\) \(h_x\text{,}\) \(h_y\text{,}\) and \(h_z\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Find a function \(g\) so that \(\partial g/\partial x =
3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x)\text{.}\) Find a function \(h\) so that \(\partial
h/\partial x = 3x^2y\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>When finding the most general antiderivative for a function of one variable, we add a constant of integration (usually denoted by \(C\)) to capture the fact that any constant will vanish through differentiation. When taking the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) of a function of \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\text{,}\) what variables can appear in terms that vanish because they are treated as constants? What does this tell you should be added to \(g\) and \(h\) in the previous part to make them the most general possible functions with the desired partial derivatives with respect to \(x\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Now calculate \(\partial g/\partial y\) and \(\partial
h/\partial y\text{.}\) Explain why this tells you that we must have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
g(x,y,z) = 3xe^{y^2}-z\cos(x)-yz+m_1(z)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h(x,y,z) = x^3y+y^2z^3+m_2(z)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>for some functions \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) depending only on \(z\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calculate \(\partial g/\partial z\) and \(\partial h/\partial z\) for the functions in the part above. Notice that \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are functions of \(z\) alone, so taking a partial derivative with respect to \(z\) is the same as taking an ordinary derivative, and thus you may use the notation \(m'_1(z)\) and \(m'_2(z)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why \(\vG\) is a gradient vector field but \(\vH\) is not a gradient vector field. Find a potential function for \(\vG\text{.}\)</p></li>
