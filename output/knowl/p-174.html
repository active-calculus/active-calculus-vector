<p>Let \(\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle\) be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, connected region \(D\text{.}\) We will assume that \(D\) is in \(\R^2\) and \(\vF\) is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to \(\R^3\text{.}\) We want to define a function \(f\) on \(D\) by using the vector field \(\vF\) and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign \(f(x_0,y_0)\) an arbitrary value. (Setting \(f(x_0,y_0)=0\) is probably convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that \(f(x_0,y_0)\) is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point \((x,y)\) in \(D\text{,}\) define</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(C\) is any oriented path from \((x_0,y_0)\) to \((x,y)\text{.}\) Since \(D\) is connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since \(\vF\) is path-independent, \(f\) is well-defined. If different paths from \((x_0,y_0)\) to \((x,y)\) gave different values for the line integral, then we'd not be sure what \(f(x,y)\) really is.</p>
