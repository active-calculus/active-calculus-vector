<p>If we are trying to figure out how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product \(\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i\) makes sense for the local amount of help/hindrance, as if the vector \(\vr_i\) along the curve and the force field vector \(\vF(\vr_i)\) point in similar directions, the dot product will be positive.<a knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. Taking the sum over \(i=0,\dots,n-1\text{,}\) we have a Riemann sum that approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft as it flies along \(C\text{:}\)</p>
