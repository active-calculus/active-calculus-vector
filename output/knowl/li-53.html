<p>Evaluating \(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\) takes more work at this stage, so let's break the process into smaller pieces.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since \(C_3\) is a line segment, find the slope-intercept (\(y=mx+b\)) form of the equation of this line.</p></li>
<li><p>Just as we noticed that along \(C_1\) we always had \(y=1\text{,}\) we now know how to express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) for all points along \(C_3\text{.}\) Use this to to express \(\vF(x,y) = \vF(x,mx+b)\) as a vector purely in terms of \(x\) for points along \(C_3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We often think of the slope of a line as being \(\Delta
y/\Delta x\text{.}\) Use this fact and the slope of the line containing \(C_3\) to express \(\Delta y\) as a multiple of \(\Delta x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We may view \(\Delta\vr\) as \(\langle \Delta x,\Delta y\rangle\text{.}\) Since \(\Delta x\approx dx\) and \(\Delta y\approx dy\text{,}\) write \(d\vr\) as a vector in terms of \(dx\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the range of \(x\)-values covered by the line segment \(C_3\) to write \(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\) as a single-variable integral of the form \(\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\) and evaluate the integral.</p></li>
