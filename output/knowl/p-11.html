<p>As <a knowl="./knowl/PA_12_1.html" title="Preview Activity 1.1.1">Preview Activity 1.1.1</a> showed you, one example of a time where it makes sense to associate a vector to each point in a region is a <em class="emphasis">velocity vector field</em> \(\vF(x,y)\) or \(\vF(x,y,z)\text{,}\) where the vector associated to the point \((x,y)\) or \((x,y,z)\) is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. <a knowl="./knowl/fig_12_1_fluid-velocity.html" title="Figure 1.1.2">Figure 1.1.2</a> shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.</p>
