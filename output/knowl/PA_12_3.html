<p>Let \(\vF=\langle xy,y^2\rangle\text{,}\) let \(C_1\) be the line segment from from \((1,1)\) to \((4,1)\text{,}\) let \(C_2\) be the line segment from \((4,1)\) to \((4,3)\text{,}\) and let \(C_3\) be the line segment from \((1,1)\) to \((4,3)\text{.}\) Also let \(C = C_1 + C_2\text{.}\) This vector field and the curves are shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_12_3_field-segments.html" title="Figure 1.3.1">FigureÂ 1.3.1</a>.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">1.3.1</span> A vector field \(\vF\) and three oriented curves.</figcaption></figure><ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Every point along \(C_1\) has \(y=1\text{.}\) Therefore, along \(C_1\text{,}\) the vector field \(\vF\) can be viewed purely as a function of \(x\text{.}\) In particular, along \(C_1\text{,}\) we have \(\vF(x,1) = \langle
x,1\rangle\text{.}\) Since every point along \(C_2\) has the same \(x\)-value, what (in terms of \(y\) only) is \(\vF\) along \(C_2\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that \(d\vr \approx \Delta \vr\text{,}\) and along \(C_1\text{,}\) we have that \(\Delta\vr = \Delta x\vi \approx dx\vi\text{.}\) Thus, \(d\vr = \langle
dx,0\rangle\text{.}\) We know that along \(C_1\text{,}\) \(\vF = \langle
x,1\rangle\text{.}\) What does this mean \(\vF\cdot d\vr\) is along \(C_1\text{?}\) What interval of \(x\)-values describes \(C_1\text{?}\) Use these facts fact to write \(\int_{C_1} \vF\cdot d\vr\) as an integral of the form \(\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\) and evaluate the integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Use an analogous approach to write \(\int_{C_2} \vF\cdot d\vr\) as a limit of the form \(\int_\alpha^\beta g(y)\, dy\) and evaluate the integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the previous parts and a property of line integrals to calculate \(\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\) without having to evaluate any additional integrals.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating \(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\) takes more work at this stage, so let's break the process into smaller pieces.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since \(C_3\) is a line segment, find the slope-intercept (\(y=mx+b\)) form of the equation of this line.</p></li>
<li><p>Just as we noticed that along \(C_1\) we always had \(y=1\text{,}\) we now know how to express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) for all points along \(C_3\text{.}\) Use this to to express \(\vF(x,y) = \vF(x,mx+b)\) as a vector purely in terms of \(x\) for points along \(C_3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We often think of the slope of a line as being \(\Delta
y/\Delta x\text{.}\) Use this fact and the slope of the line containing \(C_3\) to express \(\Delta y\) as a multiple of \(\Delta x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We may view \(\Delta\vr\) as \(\langle \Delta x,\Delta y\rangle\text{.}\) Since \(\Delta x\approx dx\) and \(\Delta y\approx dy\text{,}\) write \(d\vr\) as a vector in terms of \(dx\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the range of \(x\)-values covered by the line segment \(C_3\) to write \(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\) as a single-variable integral of the form \(\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\) and evaluate the integral.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Notice that \(C\) and \(C_3\) both start at \((1,1)\) and end at \((4,3)\text{.}\) How do the values of \(\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\) and \(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\) compare?</p></li>
<li><p>Is \(\vF\) a gradient vector field? Why or why not?<em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: If \(\vF\) were a gradient vector field, then there would be a function \(f\) such that \(\vF = \nabla f\text{.}\) What would Clairaut's theorem say in this case?</p></li>
