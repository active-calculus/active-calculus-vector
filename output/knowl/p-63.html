<p>To calculate \(\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{,}\) we'll start by working with the horizontal line segment. Along that part of \(C\text{,}\) notice that \(d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta x\vi\text{.}\) Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line integral along this portion of \(C\) consists of terms of the form \(\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
x\text{.}\) Along this part of \(C\text{,}\) \(x\) ranges from \(1\) to \(4\text{,}\) and thus we can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral \(\int_1^4 2\,
dx = 6\text{.}\) Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that agrees with the orientation of \(C\text{,}\) we are not surprised to have a positive value here.</p>
