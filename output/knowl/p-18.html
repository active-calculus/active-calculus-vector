<p>The left plot shows some of the vectors but accurately depicts all of their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand, especially along the lines \(y=x\) and \(y=-x\text{.}\) The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform scaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vector's direction is completely accurate, but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the <em class="emphasis">relative</em> magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.</p>
