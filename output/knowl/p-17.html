<p><a knowl="./knowl/PA_12_1.html" title="Preview Activity 1.1.1">Preview Activity 1.1.1</a> gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields \(\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle\) and \(\vG(x,y) =
\langle 0,-x\rangle\text{.}\) It would be impossible to sketch <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching by hand many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computer algebra systems can do a great job of making such sketches. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors are typically scaled in these plots, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in the text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field \(\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_12_1_scale-field.html" title="Figure 1.1.5">Figure 1.1.5</a>.</p>
