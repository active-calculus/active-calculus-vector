<p>If \(D\) is a subset of \(\R^2\) or \(\R^3\text{,}\) we say that \(D\) is <em class="emphasis">open</em>  provided that for every point in \(D\text{,}\) there is a disc (in \(\R^2\)) or ball (in \(\R^3\)) centered at that point such that every point of the disc/ball is contained in \(D\text{.}\) For example, the set of points \((x,y)\) in \(\R^2\) for which \(x^2+y^2 \lt 1\) is open, since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc contained in the set. However, if we change the inequality to \(x^2+y^2\leq 1\text{,}\) then the set is not open, as any point on the circle \(x^2+y^2=1\) cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside the set, that is with \(x^2+y^2&gt;1\text{.}\) We will also say that a region \(D\) is <em class="emphasis">connected</em> provided that for every pair of points in \(D\text{,}\) there is a path from one to the other contained in \(D\text{.}\)</p>
