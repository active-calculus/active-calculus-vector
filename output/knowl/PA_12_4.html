<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/A_12_3_2.html" title="Activity 1.3.3">Activity 1.3.3</a> we considered the vector field \(\vF(x,y) =
\langle y^2,2xy+3\rangle\) and two different oriented curves from \((1,0)\) to \((-1,0)\text{.}\) We found that the value of the line integral of \(\vF\) was the same along those two oriented curves.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Verify that \(\vF(x,y) = \langle y^2,2xy+3\rangle\) is a gradient vector field by showing that \(\vF = \nabla f\) for the function \(f(x,y) = xy^2 + 3y\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate \(f(-1,0)-f(1,0)\text{.}\) How does this value compare to the value of the line integral \(\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr\) you found in <a knowl="./knowl/A_12_3_2.html" title="Activity 1.3.3">Activity 1.3.3</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(C_3\) be the line segment from \((1,1)\) to \((3,4)\text{.}\) Calculate \(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\) as well as \(f(3,4)-f(1,1)\text{.}\) What do you notice? \saveCount</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We've used Clairaut's Theorem to argue that a vector field in \(\R^2\) is not a gradient vector field when \(\partial F_1/\partial
y\neq \partial F_2/\partial x\text{,}\) and earlier in this preview activity, you verified that a given vector field was the gradient of a particular function of two variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of three variables. However, in that case there are six mixed partials to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious. The remaining parts of this preview activity suggest a process for determining if a vector field in \(\R^3\) is conservative as well as finding a potential function for the vector field.</p>
<p>Let \(\vG(x,y,z) = \langle 3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x),6xy e^{y^2} -
z,3z^2-y-\cos(x)\rangle\) and \(\vH(x,y,z) = \langle 3x^2 y,x^3+2yz^3,xz+3y^2z^2\rangle\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If \(\vG\) and \(\vH\) are to be gradient vector fields, then there are functions \(g\) and \(h\) for which \(\vG = \nabla g\) and \(\vH=\nabla
h\text{.}\) What would this tell us about the partial derivatives \(g_x\text{,}\) \(g_y\text{,}\) \(g_z\text{,}\) \(h_x\text{,}\) \(h_y\text{,}\) and \(h_z\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Find a function \(g\) so that \(\partial g/\partial x =
3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x)\text{.}\) Find a function \(h\) so that \(\partial
h/\partial x = 3x^2y\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>When finding the most general antiderivative for a function of one variable, we add a constant of integration (usually denoted by \(C\)) to capture the fact that any constant will vanish through differentiation. When taking the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) of a function of \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\text{,}\) what variables can appear in terms that vanish because they are treated as constants? What does this tell you should be added to \(g\) and \(h\) in the previous part to make them the most general possible functions with the desired partial derivatives with respect to \(x\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Now calculate \(\partial g/\partial y\) and \(\partial
h/\partial y\text{.}\) Explain why this tells you that we must have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
g(x,y,z) = 3xe^{y^2}-z\cos(x)-yz+m_1(z)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h(x,y,z) = x^3y+y^2z^3+m_2(z)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>for some functions \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) depending only on \(z\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calculate \(\partial g/\partial z\) and \(\partial h/\partial z\) for the functions in the part above. Notice that \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are functions of \(z\) alone, so taking a partial derivative with respect to \(z\) is the same as taking an ordinary derivative, and thus you may use the notation \(m'_1(z)\) and \(m'_2(z)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why \(\vG\) is a gradient vector field but \(\vH\) is not a gradient vector field. Find a potential function for \(\vG\text{.}\)</p></li>
