<p>Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects. The force is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth, and its magnitude is determined by the distance between the object and the earth. An illustration of this vector field can be seen in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_12_1_gravity.html" title="Figure 1.1.3">FigureÂ 1.1.3</a>, where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at that distance.</p>
