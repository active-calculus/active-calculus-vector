<p>Recall from <span>(((Unresolved xref, reference "S_9_3_Dot_Product"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute)))</span><a href="" class="xref" title="">SectionÂ </a> that the work done by a force \(\vF\) on an object that moves with displacement vector \(\vv\) is \(\vF\cdot \vv\text{.}\) In this Preview Activity, we will consider the work done by a wind blowing due east at \(45\) miles per hour on an airplane at various stages of its journey.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>A pilot flies for an hour and finds that he is \(300\) miles from where he started at a heading of \(20^\circ\) degrees east of due north. Find the work the wind has done on the airplane during the flight.</p></li>
<li><p>An hour later, the pilot determines that he is \(275\) miles due north of where he previously checked his position. Find the work done by the wind on the airplane during the second hour of the flight.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the pilot's displacement from his original position after two hours of flying and use that to find the work done by the wind on the airplane during the first two hours of flight.</p></li>
<li><p>How does your answer to the previous part connect to the answers to the first two parts?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the pilot then flies \(45^\circ\) west of due north for \(200\) miles. Find the work done by the wind on the airplane during this part of the journey.</p></li>
