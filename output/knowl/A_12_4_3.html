<li><p>What does the previous part show must be the value of \(\oint_C

</ol>
<p>From the first part of this activity, you now now that the line integral around any closed curve in a path-independent vector field is \(0\text{.}\) What can we say about the converse? That is, suppose that \(\vF\) is a continuous vector field on a domain \(D\) for which \(\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr = 0\) for all closed curves \(C\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Pick two points \(P\) and \(Q\) in \(D\text{.}\) Let \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) be oriented curves from \(P\) to \(Q\text{.}\) What type of curve is \(C = C_1 -
C_2\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is \(\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{?}\) Why?</p></li>
<li><p>What does that tell you about the relationship between \(\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr\) and \(\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why this shows that \(\vF\) is path-independent.</p></li>
