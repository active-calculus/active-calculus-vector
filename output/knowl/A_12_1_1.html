<li><p>Starting with one of the vectors near the point \((2,0)\text{,}\) sketch a curve that follows the direction of the vector field \(\vF\text{.}\) To help visualize what you are doing, it may be useful to think of the vector field as the velocity vector field for some flowing water and that you are imagining tracing the path that a tiny particle inserted into the water would follow as the water moved it around.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the previous step for at least two other starting points not on the curve you previously sketched.</p></li>
<li><p>What shape do the curves you sketched in the previous two steps form?</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that \(\vF(x,y)\) is orthogonal to \(\langle x,y\rangle\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relationship between the function \(f(x,y) = x^2 +
y^2\) and the vector \(x\vi + y\vj\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What does this tell you about the relationship between \(\vF(x,y)\) and circles centered at the origin? What is the relationship between \(|\vF(x,y)|\) and the radius of the appropriate circle?</p></li>
