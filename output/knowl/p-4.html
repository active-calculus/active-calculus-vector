<p>Thus far vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in \(\R^2\) and \(\R^3\text{.}\) The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. That is, a curve \(\vr(t)\) is really a function that takes as input a real number and produces a vector in \(\R^2\) or \(\R^3\text{.}\) In this section we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take as input a point \((x,y)\) in \(\R^2\) or a point \((x,y,z)\) in \(\R^3\) and produce a vector (typically in \(\R^2\) or \(\R^3\text{,}\) respectively).</p>
