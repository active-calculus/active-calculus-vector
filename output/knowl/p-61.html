<p>The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to calculate line integrals, since the limit in the definition, just like the limit in the definition of every other type of integral we've studied so far, is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in the case where the oriented curve \(C\) is composed of horizontal and vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a single-variable integral, as the following example shows.</p>
