<p>We've already encountered some situations where we had evidence that a vector field was path-independent, but since the definition requires that for every pair of points in the domain and every possible pair of paths from oine point to the other we must get the same value, it doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent is an easy task. Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be shown to be path-independent. Let \(f\colon \R^3\to \R\) be a function for which \(\nabla f\) is continuous on a domain \(D\text{.}\) Suppose that \(P\) and \(Q\) are points in \(D\) and let \(C\) be a smooth oriented path from \(P\) to \(Q\text{.}\) Let's take a look at \(\int_C\nabla f \cdot d\vr\) by fixing an arbitrary parameterization \(\vr(t)\) of \(C\text{,}\) \(a\leq t \leq b\text{.}\) Since \(\nabla
f(\vr(t)) = \langle f_x(\vr(t)),f_y(\vr(t)),f_z(\vr(t))\rangle\text{,}\) we know that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr  = \int_a^b \nabla f(\vr(t))\cdot
\vr'(t)\, dt = \int_a^b \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)),
f_z(\vr(t))\rangle \cdot \vr'(t)\, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
