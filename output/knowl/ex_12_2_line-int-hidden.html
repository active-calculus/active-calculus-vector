2,1\rangle\text{.}\) Let \(C\) be the curve that follows the horizontal line segment from \((1,1)\) to \((4,1)\) and then continues down the vertical line segment to \((4,-2)\text{.}\) <a knowl="./knowl/fig_12_2_curve-field.html" title="Figure 1.2.5">FigureÂ 1.2.5</a> shows \(\vF\) and \(C\text{,}\) including the orientation.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">1.2.5</span> An oriented curve from \((1,1)\) to \((4,-2)\) in a vector field \(\vF\text{.}\)</figcaption></figure><p>To calculate \(\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{,}\) we'll start by working with the horizontal line segment. Along that part of \(C\text{,}\) notice that \(d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta x\vi\text{.}\) Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line integral along this portion of \(C\) consists of terms of the form \(\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
x\text{.}\) Along this part of \(C\text{,}\) \(x\) ranges from \(1\) to \(4\text{,}\) and thus we can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral \(\int_1^4 2\,
dx = 6\text{.}\) Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that agrees with the orientation of \(C\text{,}\) we are not surprised to have a positive value here.</p>
<p>Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of \(C\text{.}\) Here \(d\vr
\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta y\vj\text{,}\) which means that \(\vF\cdot
d\vr\approx 1\Delta y\text{.}\) Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite integral \(\int_1^{-2} 1\, dy =
-3\text{.}\) Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match the orientation of \(C\text{.}\) Also, the negative value should not be unexpected, since \(C\) is oriented in a direction for which the vectors of \(\vF\) point in a direction that would hinder motion along \(C\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Combining these two pieces of work, we find that \(\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr
= 6 - 3 = 3\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
