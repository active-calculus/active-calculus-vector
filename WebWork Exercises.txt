WebWork Problems:

Section 1: Vector Fields

Library/WHFreeman/Rogawski_Calculus_Early_Transcendentals_Second_Edition/16_Line_and_Surface_Integrals/16.1_Vector_Fields/16.1.3.pg
Library/Hope/Multi2/12-01-Vector-fields/Vector-fields-01a.pg
Library/WHFreeman/Rogawski_Calculus_Early_Transcendentals_Second_Edition/16_Line_and_Surface_Integrals/16.1_Vector_Fields/16.1.15.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/17-3-Vector-fields/HGM5-17-3-27-Vector-fields.pg

Problems 5 through 9 in the WebWork set https://webwork.sfasu.edu/webwork2/AC-VectorCalc/instructor/sets/12_1_Vector_Fields/ would offer some basic problems that could be pencil and paper




Section 2: 

Library/WHFreeman/Rogawski_Calculus_Early_Transcendentals_Second_Edition/16_Line_and_Surface_Integrals/16.2_Line_Integrals/16.2.41.pg
Library/Rochester/setVectorCalculus1/UR_VC_11_7.pg
Library/Michigan/Chap18Sec1/Q21.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/18-1-Idea-of-line-integrals/HGM4-18-1-02-Line-integrals.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/18-1-Idea-of-line-integrals/HGM4-18-1-01-Line-integrals.pg

Additional problems might include students coming up with thier own examples that have certain behaviors (either give curve then generate vf or viseversa)


Section 3:

Library/Hope/Multi2/11-06-Scalar-line-integrals/Scalar-line-integral-04.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/18-2-Line-integrals-parametrized/HGM4-18-2-11a-Line-integrals-parametrized.pg
Library/ASU-topics/setCalculus/stef16_2p1.pg
Library/UBC/calculusStewart/lineIntegrals21.pg

Problems 5-7 of https://webwork.sfasu.edu/webwork2/AC-VectorCalc/instructor/sets/12_3_Line_Inegrals_with_Parameterizations/ reference work or circulation but would be useful basic applications


Section 4: 

Library/Hope/Multi2/11-06-Scalar-line-integrals/Scalar-line-integral-04.pg
Library/Hope/Multi2/11-06-Scalar-line-integrals/Scalar-line-integral-05.pg

The following is a density application for scalar line integrals and might need a preface statement.

Section 5:

Library/Michigan/Chap20Sec5/Q08.pg
Library/Michigan/Chap18Sec3/Q25.pg
Library/ASU-topics/setCalculus/stef16_3p3.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/18-3-Gradient-fields/HGM4-18-3-27-Gradient-fields.pg


This problem would be a good conceptual question: Library/Michigan/Chap18Sec3/Q40.pg

Section 6:

Library/FortLewis/Calc3/20-1-Idea-of-divergence/HGM4-20-1-09-Divergence.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/20-1-Idea-of-divergence/HGM4-20-1-04-Divergence.pg
Library/Michigan/Chap20Sec1/Q01.pg
Library/FortLewis/Calc3/20-1-Idea-of-divergence/HGM4-20-1-22-Divergence.pg

The following is a great example of a generalization of the argument for the definition of divergence to 3D:

This might be if you have a conceptual problem asking about how much of a vector field flows through these surfaces, 
then have this as a check your answers to this type of problem.
