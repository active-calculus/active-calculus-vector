  "title": "Features of the Text",
  "body": " Features of the Text  Similar to the presentation of the single-variable Active Calculus , instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:   Motivating Questions  At the start of each section, we list motivating questions that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.    Preview Activities  Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by a preview activity . This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students in advance of class, and indeed to be completed by students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.    Activities  Every section in the text contains several activities . These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working either individually or in small groups.    Exercises  There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat a large list of standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable calculus problems. In this text, each section begins with several anonymous WeBWorK exercises, and follows with several challenging problems. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in the .html version of the text . Almost every non- WeBWorK problem has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available APEX Calculus text by Greg Hartmann et al.    Graphics  As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. The figures and the software to generate them have been created by David Austin.  In Chapter 12, the authors have used interactive Sage figure to allow users of the html version to rotate and zoom on dynamic visuals. In some figures, the user can manipulate different parameters to see how a featured element will change.    Summary of Key Ideas  Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.    Links to technological tools  Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus are best understood dynamically, and we encourage readers to make frequent use of technology to analyze graphs and data. Since technology changes so often, we refrain from indicating specific programs to use in the text. However, aside from computer algebra systems like Maple , Mathematica , or Sage , there are many free graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces or curves. These programs can be used by instructors and students to assist in the investigations and demonstrations. The use of these freely available applets is in accord with our philosophy that no one should be required to purchase materials to learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise to be openly shared. Below is a list of a few of the technological tools that are available (links active at the writing of this edition). Of course, you can find your own by searching the web.       CalcPlot3D , good all-purpose 3D graphing tool     Wolfram Alpha , useful for graphing surfaces in 2D and 3D, and for general calculations     Wolfram Alpha widgets , searchable site for simple to use programs using Wolfram Alpha     GeoGebra , all purpose graphing tool with some computer algebra capabilities.

  "title": "Vector Calculus Preface",
  "body": " Vector Calculus Preface    Recognizing that not all institutions will cover all the material in the chapter on vector calculus, we have created the following chart for the depencecies of the topics in Chapter 12.   (for accessibility)   In this flow chart, the yellow sections are not strictly dependent on the others but use some common arguments that would be helpful for a reader to have seen before working on.  Observant readers may notice that the graphics in deviate from those in the previous 11. Because so much of vector calculus relies upon visualizing things in three dimensions, we elected to produce almost all of the graphics using SageMath. This allows for a degree of consistency between the two-dimensional graphics, which are typically static, and the three-dimensional graphics, which are almost always interactive. Thus, you can grab a three-dimensional plot, rotate it, zoom in on it, etc.  To rotate a three-dimensional graphic, click and drag with your mouse.  To zoom on an interactive three-dimensional graphic, use your mouse's scroll wheel or make your operating system's scroll gesture on your touchpad.  To move a three-dimensional graphic instead of rotating, hold down the space bar while clicking and dragging.    Our Fall 2023 release includes at least some WeBWorK exercises in each of the sections of , but we welcome suggestions of additional WeBWorK exercises that faculty would consider good inclusions and feedback on any aspect of this chapter. The best way to provide feedback is through the Active Calculus - Multivariable Google Group . We will occasionally give some updates through the blog on .    Mitchel T.

  "title": "Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals",
  "body": " Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals  Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.  While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas an author presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a main purpose of this work is to present a new multivariable calculus text that is free . In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source .  In Active Calculus - Multivariable , we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.  This approach is consistent with the following goals:   To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.    To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable calculus are natural and true. We strive to accomplish this by using specific cases to highlight the ideas for the general situation using contexts that are common and familiar.    To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multivariable calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, through working on activities in small groups in class, and through doing substantial exercises outside of class time.    To strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable calculus.     "

  "title": "How to Use this Text",
  "body": " How to Use this Text  Because the text is free, any professor or student may use the electronic version of the text for no charge. For reading on laptops or mobile devices, the best electronic version to use is the .html version of the text , but you can find links to a pdf and hard copy of the text at https:\/\/activecalculus.org\/ . Furthermore, because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the full set of source files, which are available on GitHub .  This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivariable calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. Chapter introduces functions of several independent variables along with tools that will be used to study these functions, namely vectors and vector-valued functions. Chapter studies differentiation of functions of several independent variables in detail, addressing the typical topics including limits, partial derivatives, and optimization, while Chapter provides the standard topics of integration of multivariable functions.     Electronic Edition  Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them. Also, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to on-line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer. The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone.   Note. In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links, so some availalable information is suppressed. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.    Activities Workbook  Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development.    Community of Users  Because this text is free and open-source, we hope that as people use the text, they will contribute corrections, suggestions, and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate such feedback is through the Active Calculus - Multivariable Google Group .     "

  "title": "Three Dimensional Space",
  "body": " Three Dimensional Space     How can you describe a location in three dimensional space?    How do you measure distance between points in three or more dimensions?      As you read in the introduction to this chapter, we will be expanding beyond the idea of measuring change of expressions with one number as an input or output. We will first need to think about how we can represent the basic ideas of coordinates and functions in a more general setting. The following preview activity will ask you to recall some algebraic and geometric ideas from before your single variable calculus course.    In this Preview Activity, we will recall some ideas about measurements and important ideas in two dimensional space.    What are the coordinates of the point drawn in ? Draw segments from the point to the vertical and horizontal axes to demonstrate the measurements of the coordinates.   A 2D plot with point labeled   A 2D plot with a point labeled P that is three units right of the vertical axis and 1 unit above the horizontal axis       On the plot below, graph and label the following points: , , , , .   A blank 2D set of axes   A blank 2D plot where each coordinate varies from negative 4 to 4       Give the coordinates of four points on the horizontal axis and think about what aspect all of the points on the horizontal axis have in common. Use your idea on what the points on the horizontal axis have in common to give an equation for the horizontal axis.    On the axes below, draw a graph of each of the following equations: , , and    A blank 2D set of axes   A blank 2D plot where each coordinate varies from negative 4 to 4       What is the formula for the distance from to ? Use this formula to find how far is from .    Draw a plot of the points and . On your plot, draw the line segment that measures the distance between the given points and the segments that measure the horizontal and vertical changes. Your plotted segments should make a right triangle. Explain how the right triangle you drew here relates to the calculation in .    For each graph in , state whether the following graphs can be expressed with as a function of or not. If the graph cannot be expressed with as a function of , write sentence about what property you used to determine this.    Plot A   A 2D plot of a parabola opening in the positive vertical direction      Plot B   A 2D plot of a parabola opening in the positive horizontal direction        Plot C   A 2D plot of a line with slope 1 and y intercept 1      Plot D   A 2D plot of a vertical line with x intercept 2        The tasks in the should connect some of the meaning and formulas used in coordinates and graphing for two dimensions to specific measurements that will allow us to build useful tools for three or more dimensions. In the rest of this section, we will define the measurements for coordinates and basic measurements in three dimensions.    Three Dimensional Space and Coordinates  To plot points three-dimensional points, we need to set up a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes the -axis, the -axis, and the -axis (called the coordinate axes ). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a 3D coordinate system, as shown in Figure ; thus, before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.   Left: A left hand system. Right: A right hand system       The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In the coordinate system shown at left in Figure , imagine that you are sitting on the positive -axis next to the label . Looking down at the - and -axes, you see that the -axis is obtained by rotating the -axis by 90 in the clockwise direction. Again sitting on the positive -axis in the coordinate system at right in Figure , you see that the -axis is obtained by rotating the -axis by 90 in the counterclockwise direction.  We call the coordinate system at right in a right-hand system ; if we point the index finger of our right hand along the positive -axis and our middle finger along the positive -axis, then our thumb points in the direction of the positive -axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to use a right-hand system throughout this book.  We let denote the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers in the plane (two copies of the real number system) and let represent the set of all ordered triples of real numbers (which constitutes three-space). For example, is in and is in , but is not in because the second coordinate is not a real number ( is imaginary).  In other disciplines or settings you may see the y-axis as being oriented vertically with the x-axis going left\/right and the z-axis is going in and out of the page like in the figure below. This orientation may be useful for you because you can think of the traditional orientation of the -plane (when drawn on paper) with the positive -axis coming out of the page.   An alternate orientation of a right handed coordinate system for    Now that we have established how our axes will be defined, we can use these axes to define how to measure coordinates and make a few basic graphs. In two dimensions, the horizontal coordinate was measured as the (minimum) distance to the vertical axis and the vertical coordinate was measured as the (minimum) distance to the horizontal axis. These measurements are actually signed distances because the measurement is positive when the point is above the given axis and negative when the measurement is below the given axis.   shows the measurement of coordinates for , a point in the first quadrant, and , a point in the fourth quadrant. Notice that the coordinates , , and will be positive because each of the segments used to measure the distance are above the other coordinate axis. The coordinate will be negative because the segment used to measure the vertical distance to the -axis is below the -axis. This is what we mean when we say that the coordinate measurements are a signed distance; The distances to the comes from how far the point is from each axis and the sign specifies whether that distance is above or below the axis.   A plot with the 2D coordinate measurements labeled   A plot with the 2D coordinate measurements labeled for a point in the first quadrant and a point in the fourth quadrant     In a three dimensional space, we need to pay attention to the coordinate planes and not just the axes. The plot below shows how the -plane is the plane that contains the - and -axes. We can define the -plane as the plane that contain the -and -axes and the -plane as the plane that contain the -and -axes. In many ways the coordinate planes in 3D are analogous to the axes in 2D; we will split up 3D space based on whether a location is above or below different coordinate planes and we will measure coordinates in 3D as distances from the coordinate planes.   The coordinate planes in 3D    In two dimensions, the four regions that were separated by the coordinate axes are called quadrants and are typically labeled as in the plot below.   The four quadrants   A plot of the four quadrants     The coordinate planes will divide our three dimensional space up into eight different regions, which we will call octants . The octants above the -plane are ordered just like the quadrants in 2D and octants 5 through 8 have the same relationships but below the -plane.   A plot of the eight octants    The location of a point in a three dimensional space is measured with three coordinates. The three dimensional rectangular coordinates are measured as the signed distances to each of the coordinate planes. For example, the point is shown in the following plot.   A plot of the point    Notice how hard it is to see where that point is located without turning the axes. In the web version of this text, most plots in 3D will be interactive, which means you click and drag to rotate the perspective. Additionally, you can zoom in and out by either using a scroll wheel on a mouse or pinching on touch screens.  When drawing points (or other plots) in 3D, it is often useful to draw segments or other features that are parallel to coordinate axes in order to help the viewer see the proper orientation and locations. For instance, see how much easier it is to understand the location of the point in the plot below because of the parallel structures that are shown on the plot.   A plot of the point with line segments parallel to the coordinate axes     shows the segments used to measure the coordinates in 3D as they are measured from the point to the coordinate planes. Many plots will not show the coordinate planes. Framing the important measurements of your plot with structures that are parallel to the coordinate axes is a very useful to make your plots more easily understood. For instance, see how much easier it is to understand the location of the point in because of the parallel structures that are shown on the plot. In particular, you can see the - and -coordinates measured in the -plane with the -coordinate extended up. The segments drawn in are easy enough to add to a drawing done by hand.   A plot of the point with line segments parallel to the coordinate axes     Drawing Points in 3D   In this problem to move forward or backwards is to move in the direction of positive (the -coordinate increases, the and remain the same) or negative (the -coordinate decreases, the and remain the same), respectively; to the right or to the left is moving in the positive or negative direction, respectively; up or down is moving in the positive or negative direction, respectively:   Find the coordinates of the point where one ends if one starts at point and moves 5 units forward, 4 units to the left, and 2 units up.  Draw the point (that is your answer to task ) on a set of 3D axes and include the line segments that show that coordinate's points as a set of directions from the origin (like in ).  Find the coordinates of the point where one ends if one starts at point and moves 4 units backwards, 4 units to the right, and 4 units down.  Draw the point (that is your answer to task ) on a set of 3D axes and include the line segments that show that coordinate's points as a set of directions from the origin (like in ).     Fundamental Planes  At this point we will want to understand graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in , the graphs of the equations and , where and are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. Remember that a graph of an equation is a plot of all points that satisfy this equation; This means that the graph of an equation is a visual representation of all locations whose coordiantes will make the left side of your equation equal to the right side of the equation. The equation should give you a way to test whether a point is on the graph or not. For instance, the graph of in two dimensions will be a vertical line with intercept of 2, because the points of the form satisfy the equation (for any choice of .) In the next activity we consider the three-dimensional analogs.    Consider the set of points that satisfy the equation . Describe this set as best you can.   The set of points where is all the points such that , which creates a plane that is parallel to the yz-plane and goes through .   The set of points where is all the points such that , which creates a plane that is parallel to the yz-plane and goes through .    Consider the set of points that satisfy the equation . Describe this set as best you can.   The set of points where is all the points such that , which creates a plane that is parallel to the xz-plane and goes through .   The set of points where is all the points such that , which creates a plane that is parallel to the xz-plane and goes through .    Consider the set of points that satisfy the equation . Describe this set as best you can.   The set of points where is all the points such that , which creates a plane that is parallel to the xy-plane and goes through .   The set of points where is all the points such that , which creates a plane that is parallel to the xy-plane and goes through .     Activity shows that the equations where one of the rectangular coordinates is held constant leads to planes parallel to the coordinate planes. When we make the constant 0, we get the coordinate planes coordinate planes . The -plane satisfies , the -plane satisfies , and the -plane satisfies (see Figure ). Planes of the form , , are called fundamental planes are useful in understanding and building many different structures in 3D. In a plot like , you see a grid that helps measure coordinates of points in 2D. below has a lot of visual clutter and is very hard to distinguish fine features, especially something in the middle of the plot. Contrast this to how helpful the grid in is.   A grid of fundamental planes in 3D       Distance Formula in 3D  On a related note, we define a circle in as the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point. In , we call the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point a sphere sphere definition . To find the equation of a sphere, we need to understand how to calculate the distance between two points in three-space, and we explore this idea in the next activity.    Let and be two points in . These two points form opposite vertices of a rectangular box whose sides are planes parallel to the coordinate planes as illustrated in Figure , and the distance between and is the length of the blue diagonal shown in Figure .   A plot of and with connecting segments       Consider the right triangle in the base of the box whose hypotenuse is shown as the red line in Figure . What are the coordinates of and ?     .     .    Give the equation of the plane that contains the right triangle .   One of the coordinates is the same for all three points .            Since the right triangle lies in a plane, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a formula for the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle. Find the length of the segment in terms of , , , and .    .    .    The triangle has hypotenuse drawn with the blue segment connecting the points and with a leg as the hypotenuse of the triangle lies entirely in a plane, so we can again use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of its hypotenuse. Show that the length of is             The method used in Activity does not depend on anything but the coordinates between the two points, so we can use the last result to measure the distance between any two points in .   The distance between points in 3D  The distance between points and (denoted as ) in is given by the formula    As Activity showed, the distance in two or three (or more!) dimensions depends on the change in each coordinate from one point to the other. Note that the distance does not depend on whether we consider to or to .  Equation can be used to derive the formula for a sphere centered at a point with radius . Since the distance from any point on such a sphere to the point is , the point will satisfy the equation   Squaring both sides, we come to the standard equation for a sphere.   The equation of a sphere  The equation of a sphere with center and radius is    This makes sense if we compare this equation to its two-dimensional analogue, the equation of a circle of radius in the plane centered at :     Summary    Coordinates in three dimensional space are measured in terms of distances from a location to the coordinate planes.    In , the distance between points and (denoted as ) is given by the formula and thus the equation of a sphere with center and radius is         (A) If the positive z-axis points upward, an equation for a horizontal plane through the point is  .  (B) An equation for the plane perpendicular to the x-axis and passing through the point is  .  (C) An equation for the plane parallel to the xz-plane and passing through the point is  .                        You are given the following points: , , .  Which point is closest to the yz-plane?   A    B    C    What is the distance from the yz-plane to this point?  Which point is farthest from the xy-plane?   A    B    C    What is the distance from the xy-plane to this point?  Which point lies on the xz-plane?   A    B    C                              SOLUTION  The distance from a point to the -plane is the absolute value of the -coordinate.  The point has the coordinate with the smallest absolute value, so is the point closest to the - plane.  The distance from the -plane to is given by the absolute value of the -coordinate, i.e. .  The distance from a point to the -plane is the absolute value of the -coordinate.  The point has the coordinate with the largest absolute value, so is the point farthest from the - plane.  The distance from the -plane to is given by the absolute value of the -coordinate, i.e. .  A point lies on the -plane if its -coordinate is zero. Thus lies on the -plane.         Find a formula for the shortest distance from a point to the -axis.  distance =              Find the distance from to each of the following:  1. The -plane.  Answer:  2. The -plane.  Answer:  3. The -plane.  Answer:  4. The -axis.  Answer:  5. The -axis.  Answer:  6. The -axis.  Answer:                                 SOLUTION  1. The distance from a point to the -plane is the absolute value of the -coordinate of the point. Thus, the distance is .  2. The distance from a point to the -plane is the absolute value of the -coordinate of the point. Thus, the distance is .  3.

How do we determine the length of a vector? What is a unit vector, and how do we find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector?      Quantities like length, speed, area, and mass are all measured using a single number (a scalar ). Other quantities, like velocity, force, and displacement, have two attributes: magnitude and direction. These quantities are represented by vectors and are the study of this section. For example, we will use vectors to calculate work done by a constant force, calculate torque, determine direction vectors for lines and normal vectors for planes, define curvature, and determine the direction of greatest increase on a surface. For most of these applications, we will be interested in using vectors to measure the direction of some aspect of the application while needing to also pay attention to the magnitude of this measurement. Vectors will be an essential tool for us in describing the behavior of functions of several variables.     Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to specify how to generate text or graphics. The following is a simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices , , and : (0,0) moveto (1,1) lineto stroke (1,-1) lineto stroke (0,0) lineto stroke The process described by these commands is 1) tell Postscript to start at the point , 2) draw a line from the point to the point (this is what the line to and stroke commands do), then 3) draw lines from to and 4) back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair (this pair is a vector ), where is the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point is represented by but the vector from the point to the origin is represented by .    What is the vector that describes the displacement from the point to the point ?        .    How can we use the two components of to determine the distance from the point to the point ?   The distance from to is the the length (magnitude) of .     .    Suppose we want to draw the triangle with vertices , , and . As a shorthand notation, we will denote the vector from the point to the point as . Determine the vectors , , and .    , , and     , , and .    How are the horizontal displacements of and related to the horizontal displacement of ? Does the same relationship follow for the vertical displacements? Write a couple of sentences to explain your reasoning in the context of this problem.     . A triangle has 3 sides. and form two sides of the triangle. When we add these together, the vector formed creates the 3rd side of the triangle.    .   .      Representations of Vectors   Preview Activity shows how we can record the length and direction of a change in position using a pair of numbers . In particular, these numbers measure the change in each coordinate direction separately. There are many quantities other than displacement, such as force and velocity, that possess the attributes of magnitude and direction, and we will call such quantity a vector .    A vector vector definition is a quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction.    We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment, with the magnitude as the length of the segment and an arrowhead indicating direction, as shown at left in Figure .   Left: A vector. Right: Representations of the same vector.       According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of magnitude (length) and direction; the vector's position, however, is not mentioned. Consequently, any two vectors having the same magnitude and direction are equal, as shown at right in Figure . In other words, two vectors are equal provided they have the same magnitude and direction. This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many different ways.  Vectors do not have a particular starting or ending point, but it will be useful to use directed line segments like as a specific representative of a vector. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector , which represents a horizontal change of (positive) three units and a vertical change of (positive) four units. We may place the tail of the vector (the point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the tip (the terminal point of the vector) at , as illustrated at left in Figure . A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in standard position .   The point at the tail of a vector is often called the initial point or starting point. The point at the end of the vector is often called the terminal point or final point. The entries of the vector measure the change in each coordinate separately. Remember that change is measured as final minus initial .    Left: The vector is standard position. Right: The vector represented from to .            Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector at another point, such as . After a displacement of three units to the right and four units up, the tip of the vector is at the point (see the vector on right in ).  In this example, the vector was represented by the directed line segment from to , which we denote as . We may also turn the situation around: given the two points and , we obtain the vector because we move horizontally three units and vertically four units to get from to . In other words, . In general, the vector from the point to is found by taking the difference of coordinates, so that   We will use arrows over the name\/letters to represent vectors, such as , to distinguish them from scalars. The entries of a vector are called its components ; in the vector , the component is 3 and the component is 4. We use pointed brackets and the term components to distinguish a vector from a point and its coordinates .  There is, however, a close connection between vectors and points. Given a point , we will frequently consider the vector from the origin to . For instance, if , then as in Figure . In this way, we think of a point as defining a vector whose components agree with the coordinates of . The vector is called the position vector position vector of .   A point defines a vector in standard position       While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since pictures will be easier to draw and demonstrate the necessary characteristics, many situations will require the use of vectors in three or more dimensions. For instance, a vector in -dimensional space, , has components and may be represented as   Our next activity will help us to become accustomed to vectors and their relationship to points in three dimensions.     After being bored in your previous calculus class (and definitely not in multivariable calculus) you count the floor tiles to see how large the room is. You now know that the room is 32 feet wide and 42 feet in length. Additionally, your tall friend Chuck can barely jump and touch the ceiling which means the ceiling is 10 feet high. Your calculus professor notices you doing these measurements and decides to create a classroom coordinate system. Your professor walks to the center of the room and notices that their head is five feet above the ground and sets their head as the origin of the classroom coordinate system. Your friend Alice is sitting at , a projector is located at position , and your rival Carlos is standing at point , all distances are measured in feet.    Determine the components of the indicated vectors and explain in context what each represents.                      . This represents the displacement of the student's seat from the center of the classroom.     . This represents the displacement of the projector from the center of the classroom.     .

This represents the displacement of the teacher from the projector.         Equality of Vectors  Because initial and final locations are not mentioned in the definition of a vector, any two vectors that have the same magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have an algebraic way to determine when this occurs. That is, if we know the components of two vectors and , we will want to be able to determine algebraically when and are equal. There is an straightforward set of conditions that we use in terms of components.   Equality of Vectors  Two vectors and in are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal: and .  More generally, two vectors and in are equal if and only if for every from to .     Operations on Vectors  Vectors are not numbers (scalars), but we can now represent them with components that are real numbers. As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible to add two vectors together, multiply two vectors, or combine vectors in any other ways. In this section, we will study two operations on vectors: vector addition and scalar multiplication. To begin, we investigate a natural way to think about combining vectors in the context of measuring the change of location.    In this problem, we will be navigating to help find a friend who is lost at a local state park. We will be navigating using traditional map coordinates with east going in the positive -direction and north going in the positive -direction.    Your friend told you they would be staying 3 km east and 4 km north of the main parking lot. You drive to the parking lot and park next to your friend's car, then hike 3 km east and 4 km north. You get to the location you expected your friend to be at, but you don't find your friend and call the ranger station. The ranger station says they think your friend is 1 km west and 4 km north of your current location.  Let be the vector that represents your hike from your car to the expected location of your friend, be the vector that represents the vector from your current location to the ranger's suggested location, and be the vector from your car to the ranger's suggested location. Compute the components of , , and .    Draw a picture that represents , , and with the reference points being the location of your car, being your current position, and being the ranger's suggested location.    In the context of this problem, explain why you can add the horizontal components of and to get the horizontal component of . Write a sentence or two about why this argument should work for the vertical components as well.    After hiking to the location suggested by the ranger, you still don't see your friend and call the ranger station again. The regional manager of rangers answers this time and says the first ranger made a mistake in their navigation. A drone spotted your friend along the same direction from your car to your current location but your friend is three times as far away you are from your car. In order to avoid confusion or any other mistakes, you want to compute the vector from your car to the drone's suggested location, which we will call . What are the components of and how does that compare to ?   After hiking to the drone's suggested location, you find your friend. Yay! On the walk back to your car with your friend, you decide to help make sure the first ranger understands vectors; in particular, you want to let them know what direction they should have told you to go from . Use the components of and to figure out what the first ranger should have told you.    In we saw how adding two vectors componentwise gave a vector that represented the total change of traveling along one vector then doing the change described by the other vector. Additionally, we saw that if we wanted to go three times as far in a direction given by a vector, then we could describe the total change by multiplying each component by three. Finally, we saw that we could find the difference between two vectors by subtracting componentwise. This difference vector completed a triangle given by starting the two vectors at the same initial point. The ideas of adding vectors or multiplying a scalar by a vector generalizes beyond the context of .  In general, we can add vectors and componentwise to get , where gives the total change described by then . We define the scalar multiplication of vectors componentwise as well; If is a real number, then . Geometrically, the scalar multiplication of by will scale (stretch\/shrink) by a factor of .  We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we can add together scalar multiples of vectors. This allows us to define vector subtraction vector subtraction , , as the sum of and times , so that You can alternatively think of of as the vector you need to add to to get a result of (as you did in .)  Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often represent vectors in terms of the special vectors and . For instance, we can write the vector in as which means that   In , we let , , and , and we can write the vector in as Here is the cursed i version I made   The vectors , , and are called the standard unit vectors (as we will learn momentarily, unit vectors have length 1), and are commonly used in the physical sciences.    Properties of Vector Operations  We know that the sum (of scalars) is equal to the sum . This is called the commutative property of scalar addition. Any time we define operations on objects (like addition of vectors) we usually want to know what kinds of properties the operations have. For example, is addition of vectors a commutative operation? To answer this question we take two arbitrary vectors and and add them together and see what happens. Let and . Now we use the fact that , , , and are scalars, and that the addition of scalars is commutative to see that   So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication.   Properties of vector operations  Let , , and be vectors in and let and be scalars. Then             The vector has the property that . The vector is called the zero vector .     . The vector is called the additive inverse of the vector .                    .      We verified the first property for vectors in ; it is straightforward to verify that the rest of the eight properties just noted hold for all vectors in since all of the operations are done componentwise on the vectors.    In this activity, you should use the properties of vectors from above to simplify each of the following expressions into a single vector (of the form .) For this activity, let , , and .                        Give the vector that fills in the blank:     Explain why the following expression does not make sense:       Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations  Next, we explore the geometric representations of vector addition and scalar multiplication which will allow us to visualize these operations. Let and . Then , as shown on the left in Figure .   A vector sum (left), summing displacements (center), the parallelogram law (right).               If we think of these vectors as displacements (measuring change in position) in the plane, we can see a geometric way to envision vector addition. For instance, the vector will represent the displacement obtained by following the displacement with the displacement . We may picture this by placing the tail of at the tip of , as seen in the center of Figure . In other words, the change described by is given by going along then immediately along .  Vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if we place the tail of at the tip of . We therefore see that appears as the diagonal of the parallelogram vector sum, parallelogram determined by and , as shown at right in Figure .  Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation. At left in we see vectors , , and . If we rewrite , we have the arrangement shown at right in Figure . In other words, to form the difference , we draw a vector from the tip of to the tip of . This should make sense with our other interpretation of vector subtraction as well; the vector is what you need to add to to get , which is stated algebraically as .   Left: Vector addition. Right: Vector subtraction.            In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a vector. For instance, if , then . As shown in Figure , multiplying by 2 leaves the direction unchanged, but stretches by 2. Remember that , which describes the total change of doing then again and thus gives a result that will be in same direction as . Also, , which shows that multiplying by a negative scalar gives a vector pointing in the opposite direction of .   Scalar multiplication        motivates the following definition of parallel vectors; Vectors and (in are parallel if there exists a non-zero scalar such that . In other words, parallel vectors are (non-zero) scalar multiples of each other. There are a couple of things to note that are important about parallel vectors. First, the zero vector, is not parallel to any other vector. Geometrically, this should make sense because the zero vector is the only vector that has no change and that will not correspond to any direction. Second, parallel vectors do not have to be in the same direction; in fact, parallel vectors can be in exactly opposite directions, as shown by and in . Parallel vectors are extremely useful when trying to classify the orientation of lines, planes, and changes on surfaces.    Suppose that and are the vectors shown in .   Left: Sketch sums. Right: Sketch multiples.              On the axes at left in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    What are the components of ?            On the axes at right in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    Give a geometric description of the set of terminal points of the vectors where is any scalar.   The set of terminal points of the vectors is the line through the origin in the direction of .   On the set of axes at right in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    On the set of axes at right in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    Give a geometric description of the set of terminal points of the vectors where is any scalar.    is the line through the terminal point of in the direction of .    is the line through the terminal point of in the direction of .    Before we move on to the magnitude of a vector, we will take a moment to point out a concept that permeates most the mathematics you will see for awhile. Our definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication give us a way to take a few vectors and generate entire spaces with both familiar algebraic and geometric properties. We say that is a linear combination of the vectors and (where and are scalars). Earlier in this section we mentioned how every vector in can be written as a linear combination of , , and . Important questions in the next few math courses include things like Can you write any vector in as a linear combination of , , and ? For now, we will point out that much of what has been done in this section is setting up the algebraic and geometric properties of linear combinations as a function of the vectors used.    The Magnitude of a Vector  By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or length). We will now investigate how to calculate the magnitude of a vector. Since a vector can be represented by a directed line segment, we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of the segment. This length is the magnitude of the vector and is denoted .   The magnitude of a vector is measured as a the length of the directed line segments that represent the vector. For example, the directed line segment in will represent a vector with components of and , which represent the horizontal and vertical changes from to . Notice that when we apply the distance formula to find the length of the segment from to , we compute and which are the components of the vector we are finding the magnitude of.    Left: . Right: An arbitrary vector, .            Because the distance formula in uses the sum of the squares of the change in each coordinate, we can see that given a vector will have magnitude . Vectors of length one will be useful for describing directions without a focus on the magnitude. A unit vector is a vector whose magnitude is 1. Scalar multiplication gives us a very useful tool for describing a unit vector in a particular direction because we will need to stretch\/shrink a given vector to length 1. Our vector given by will have magnitude , so the vector will have length 1 and will be in the same direction as .       Let and . Find , , and . Is it true that ?    , , ,     , , ,     Under what conditions will ? (Hint: Think about how , , and form the sides of a triangle.)    only if and are scalars of one another.    , , and form the sides of a triangle. is the path from the tail of to tip of . The length of should be shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other sides. The only case where is if the 2 vectors lie on the same ray and have the same direction. This would mean each vector is a scalar of the other vector.    With the vector , find the lengths of , , and , respectively, and use proper notation to label your results.    , ,     , ,     In general, if is any scalar, how will related to ?

To find a unit vector in the same direction as , we need to divide by .   .  The unit vector in the direction of is .    Find a unit vector in the opposite direction to .       To find a unit vector in the opposite direction as , we need to divide by , then multiply by -1.   .  The unit vector in the direction of is .      Summary    A vector is an object that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities are position, velocity, acceleration, and force.    Two vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude. Notice that position is not considered, so a vector is independent of its location.    If and are two vectors in , then their vector sum is the vector If is a vector in and is a scalar, then the scalar multiple is the vector     The magnitude of the vector in is the scalar A vector is a unit vector provided that . If is a nonzero vector, then the vector is a unit vector with the same direction as .

  "title": "The Dot Product",
  "body": " The Dot Product     How is the dot product of two vectors defined and what geometric information does it tell us?    How can we tell if two vectors in are perpendicular?    How can we find how much of one vector is parallel to another?      In , we considered how to do vector addition and scalar multiplication algebraically and what the corresponding geometric meaning is. In this section, we will introduce a type of vector multiplication that will be used to measure how much two vectors move together. First we will discuss what is meant by move together in the context of vectors in a one-dimensional space (number line),then we will generalize this idea to two dimensions in .  We will now consider one-dimensional vectors which are denoted . Notice that vectors in one dimension will only have one component. Graphically, these vectors will look like an arrow on the number line corresponding to the change described by the component. Remember that vector do not have an inherent starting or ending location, so we can translate vectors (without changing the magnitude or direction).   A plot of and in red and blue, respectively    A plot of and in red and blue, respectively      Given two vectors, we want measure how much these vectors move together with a scalar measurement. For instance, if we let and , then we can graphically represent these starting from the origin as in . We want a multiplicative, scalar measure of how much and move together, so let's multiply their (one) components. By multiplying our components, we get . You probably notice the negative in this measurement first, so let's make sense of this right away.   A plot of and in red and blue, respectively    A plot of and in red and blue, respectively      The red and blue vectors in move completely opposite of each other, which is why we got a negative result. Generalizing this idea for all one-dimensional vectors, we see that taking the product of the components of the vectors will give a positive result when the vectors are in the same direction and a negative result when the vectors move opposite of each other. For example, the pair of vectors and will move together exactly as much as and will together. Note that the product of components for each of these pairs is .   Plots of and together and and together         Changing the length of the vectors in the pair you are comparing will also affect how much the vectors move together as measured by the product of the components (in one-dimension). For example, the pair of vector and do not move together as much as the pair of vectors and do. In fact, the product of the components says that the pair of vector and move only a third as much together as and do. This should make sense because there are not as long of arrows in the first figure as the second in .   Plots of and together and and together         Our one dimensional examples above motivate why we will use the product of components to measure how much vectors move together, but we pause now to say something about what move together does NOT mean. Specifically, when we ask how much and move together, we are NOT measuring how much of is in the direction of or how much of is in the direction of . Additionally, we are NOT measuring the difference between and . We need a scalar result (and not a vector) to measure how much and move together because this measurement of together does not have an associated direction. In the following Preview Activity, we will use our measurement of moving together in one-dimension, as computed by the product of the vector components, to develop a meaning for what moving together means in a two-dimensional setting.    Let's look at some examples to understand what we mean by moving together for 2D vectors. In particular, we will use the following:    Draw representatives of each of on the plane.   A plot of the 2D plane   A plot of the 2D plane       Multiply the first components of and and use your ideas from one-dimensional vectors to explain what this value says about how much and move together horizontally.    Multiply the second components of and and use your ideas from one-dimensional vectors to explain what this value says about how much and move together vertically.    Add together the results of the previous two parts and explain how this sum relates to how much and move together. You should also look at a plot of and starting at the same point.          Multiply the horizontal and vertical components of and separately and use these results to write about how much and together horizontally and how much and move together vertically.    Add together the two results of the previous task and explain how this sum relates to how much and move together. You should also look at a plot of and starting at the same point.       Multiply the horizontal and vertical components of and separately then add the two results. Use this number and a plot of and starting at the same point to explain how much and move together.      The Dot Product  We can extend the ideas of to any dimension which will give us the definition of the dot product.    The dot product dot product of vectors and in is the scalar      As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural to define the dot product in this context, but it is more convenient from a mathematical perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then view work as an application of this definition.   For instance, we find that   Notice that the resulting quantity is a scalar. Our work in examined dot products of one- and two-dimensional vectors.    Determine each of the following.                              The dot product is a natural way to define a product of two vectors to measure how much the vectors move together. Additionally, the dot product behaves in ways that are similar to the product of real numbers.   Properties of the dot product  Let , , and be vectors in . Then    (the dot product is commutative )     (the dot product can be distributed across vector addition)    if is a scalar, then (the dot product is associative with scalar multiplication)      In addition to the algebraic properties listed above, the dot product gives us valuable geometric information about the vectors and their relative orientation. For instance, let's consider what happens when we dot a vector with itself:   In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the square of the length of the vector: .    The Angle between Vectors  As you saw in , the dot product measures how much vectors move together and can help us understand the angle between two vectors. If we are given two vectors and , there are two angles that these vectors create, as depicted at left in Figure . We will call , the smaller of these angles, the angle between these vectors vector angle between . Notice that lies between 0 and because we would consider the angle from the other side if the angle was greater than .   Left: The angle between vectors for two different configurations of and     A plot of two vectors with an acute angle between them     A plot of two vectors with an obtuse angle between them        Given vectors and , the following relationship holds for being the smallest angle between the vectors: Solving for the angle , we get the following:     To determine this angle, we may apply the Law of Cosines to the triangle shown at right in Figure .   A triangle of vectors, , , and    A plot of two vectors with an acute angle between them     Using the fact that the dot product of a vector with itself gives us the square of its length, together with other properties of the dot product, we find:     The real beauty of is this: the dot product is a very simple algebraic calculation to perform yet it provides us with important geometric information about the angle between the vectors that would be difficult to determine otherwise. This should not be that surprising because we defined the dot product to measure how much vectors moved together, thus the dot product would be related to the angle between the vector inputs. While you normally need to interpret the angle that comes out of an inverse trig function, the result of does not need to be interpreted because the angle measurement and the range of arccos are both from to .    Determine each of the following:    The length of the vector using the dot product        The angle between the vectors and to the nearest tenth of a degree          So .    The angle between the vectors and to the nearest tenth of a degree        .   and .  Then . So .    If the angle between the vectors and is a right angle, what does the expression say about their dot product?       If the angle between 2 vectors is a right angle, the angle measure is . . Therefore . So .    If the angle between the vectors and is acute that is, less than what does the expression say about their dot product?    is positive   If the angle between 2 vectors is acute, the angle measure is between and . is between 0 and 1. Therefore is positive. So is positive.    If the angle between the vectors and is obtuse that is, greater than what does the expression say about their dot product?    is negative   If the angle between 2 vectors is obtuse, the angle measure is between and . is between -1 and 0. Therefore is negative. So is negative.      The Dot Product and Orthogonality  When the angle between two vectors is a right angle, it is frequently the case that something important is happening. In this case, we say the vectors are orthogonal . For instance, orthogonality often plays a role in optimization problems; to determine the shortest path from a point in to a given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to the plane.  As Activity indicates, the dot product provides a simple means to determine whether two vectors are orthogonal to one another. In this case, , so we make the following important observation.   The dot product and orthogonality  Two vectors and in are orthogonal vectors orthogonal to each other if .   More generally, the sign of the dot product gives us useful information about the relative orientation of the vectors. If we remember that we see that for nonzero vectors and , This is illustrated in Figure .   The orientation of vectors    Earlier in this section we referred to the dot product as measuring how much two vectors move together. We should emphasize that this is a different idea than asking how much of one vector is in the direction of another, which would have a vector as an answer. The relationship between the sign of the dot product and the angle between the vectors reinforces the idea of how much two vectors move together (or apart). We would say two vectors move together a positive amount if they have an acute angle between them, meaning that the net amount of how much the components of the vectors move together\/apart is positive. Vectors that do not move together at all would have a right angle between them and thus the dot product would be zero. Vectors with a negative dot product will move opposite each other more than together (as a sum of the components moving together\/apart), thus they will have an obtuse angle between them.    Work, Force, and Displacement  In physics, work is a measure of the energy required to apply a force to an object through a displacement. In , we can see a diagram showing the force applied to a refrigerator (in orange) that is used to move the refrigerator from point to point . The change in location, , is called the displacement. Notice that not all of the force is in the direction of the displacement. The work done on the refrigerator only depends on the amount of force that is in the direction of .   A diagram showing the force applied to the refrigerator as the refrigerator is moved from to    A diagram showing the force applied to the refrigerator as the refrigerator is moved from to     The work required to move the refrigerator the object is   This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the force applied parallel to the displacement and the length of the displacement. Consequently, if we are given two vectors and , we would like to write as a sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to and one of which is orthogonal to . We will talk about this after the following activity.    Determine the work done by a 25 pound force acting at a angle to the direction of the object's motion, if the object is pulled 10 feet. In addition, is more work or less work done if the angle to the direction of the object's motion is ?     lb-ft.     lb-ft.  If the angle is increased, the value of decreases and approaches 0.

The wind assistance is a measure of the wind speed that is helping push the runners down the track. It is much easier to run a very fast race if the wind is blowing hard in the direction of the race. So that world records aren't dependent on the weather conditions, times are only recorded as record times if the wind aiding the runners is less than or equal to 2 meters per second. Wind speed for a race is recorded by a wind gauge that is set up close to the track. It is important to note, however, that weather is not always as cooperative as we might like. The wind does not always blow exactly in the direction of the track, so the gauge must account for the angle the wind makes with the track. Suppose a 4 mile per hour wind is blowing to aid runners by making a angle with the race track. Determine if any times set during such a race would qualify as records.   The wind is below 2 m\/s so all times would qualify as records.   Convert miles per hour to meters per second. Then which is less than 2 mph.     Molecular geometry is the geometry determined by arrangements of atoms in molecules. Molecular geometry includes measurements like bond angle, bond length, and torsional angles. These attributes influence several properties of molecules, such as reactivity, color, and polarity.   A methane molecule.     As an example of the molecular geometry of a molecule, consider the methane molecule, as illustrated in Figure . According to the Valence Shell Electron Repulsion (VSEPR) model, atoms that surround single different atoms do so in a way that positions them as far apart as possible. This means that the hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The bond angle for methane is the angle determined by two consecutive hydrogen atoms and the central carbon atom. To determine the bond angle for methane, we can place the center carbon atom at the point and the hydrogen atoms at the points , , , and . Find the bond angle for methane to the nearest tenth of a degree.    .   The vector from is .  The vector from is .   .   .    "

  "title": "The Cross Product",
  "body": " The Cross Product     How and when is the cross product of two vectors defined?    What geometric information does the cross product provide?      The last two sections have introduced some basic algebraic operations and useful geometric interpretations for vector addition, scalar multiplication, and the dot product. In this section, we will define and explore the cross product , another algebraic operation which measures useful geometric information related to pairs of vectors in .  Remember that we use a right-hand coordinate system, as described in Section . In particular, recall that the vectors , , and are oriented as shown below in Figure . We would like to think of a right handed coordinate system in terms of vectors that are not just , , and .   Basis vectors , , and .    We will call an ordered list of vectors a right-handed coordinate system (or right handed orientation) if when you put the fingers of your right hand in the direction of and curl your fingers in the direction of , then the thumb of your right hand will point in the direction of . Remember that to get this orientation correct, you may need to rotate your right hand to get your fingers to curl in the correct direction, which will then give you the proper direction for the third vector .   A right handed orientation of vectors   Adapted from https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Right_hand_rule_cross_product.svg with credit to user KdYpUvMgT.     We would like to create a product of two vectors, which we will call the cross product, that creates a right handed coordinate system with the input vectors as the first two vectors in our coordinate system. So if and are not parallel, we want the cross product of with (denoted ) to make a right-handed coordinate system. Additionally, we would like the cross product (as with all of our vector operations) to work well with linear combinations of vectors. Specifically, we want the following algebraic property to be satisfied: An important difference to note here is that the cross product of two vectors will be a vector, whereas the dot product of two vectors gives a scalar.   In other sources, you may see the dot product referred to as the scalar product of vectors and the cross product referred to as the vector product. These terms comes from the result of the dot product being a scalar and the result of the cross product being a vector.     Our first task is to understand what it means to complete a right-handed coordinate system. For each of the cases below, you need to give a vector that fills in the blank to create a right-handed coordinate system. For example, the answer that would complete would be . You should pay attention to when you have vectors that are in the opposite directions of or or .                                         Explain why there is not a way to complete to be a right-handed coordinate system.   Because both vectors are in the same direction, it is not possible to specify a right handed orientation. You can't curl your fingers in the same direction they are extended in the right handed orientation definition.    As we said in the introduction, we would like the cross product to make sense over vector sums ( ). Compute each of the following geometrically. You should focus on the direction of the vector needed to complete the right handed coordinate system and not worry about the length of the vector you are using.        Be sure to note how your thumb is oriented in the last case and verify that the sum of the first two results gives you the last case.               We also want to make sure that the cross product works well with scalar multiplication.  What direction should the third vector in the right hand coordinate system be?   What direction should the third vector in the right hand coordinate system be?   Note that , so . What do you think the vector be?  What do you think the result of will be?        direction   direciton           Computing the cross product  As we have seen in Preview Activity , the cross product will be defined for two vectors and in and produces another vector in . Using the right-hand rule, we saw that                            We want the cross product to distribute over linear combinations ( ), so using the ideas directly above, we can compute the cross product in terms of the components of general vectors. Applying these ideas of right-handed coordinate systems and the cross product working with linear combinations of vectors gives us the following:    Like the dot product, the cross product arises in physical applications, e.g., torque, but it is more convenient mathematically to begin from an algebraic perspective.     The cross product cross product  of vectors and in is the vector     At first, this may look intimidating and difficult to remember. However, if we rewrite the expression in Equation using determinants, important structure emerges. The determinant of a matrix is   It follows that we can thus rewrite Equation in the form   For those familiar with the determinant of a matrix, we write the mnemonic as    We will use the definition of cross product to check some of our work from . First, we want to check a calculation like from part (a). We will write both and in their component forms of and . So will be computed as which matches our answer of from the Preview Activity.  Next we want to check our work from part (c) when we found geometrically. which matches our answer of from part (c) of the Preview Activity.  For our last part of this example we will verify our calculation of from part (d) of the Preview Activity. Which should match our work of from the last part of the Preview Activity.     Suppose and . Use the formula for the following.    Find the cross product .        .   .    Evaluate the dot products and . What does this tell you about the geometric relationship among , , and ?    , . This tells us and are both parallel to     , . This tells us and are both parallel to .    Find the cross product .        .   .    Multiplication of real numbers is associative , which means, for instance, that . Is it true that the cross product of vectors is associative? For instance, is it true that ?   The associative property does not hold for the cross product    .   .   .   .  The associative property does not hold for the cross product.    Find the cross product and write a sentence or two to explain the meaning of your result.   Your ideas for will apply here.        .   .    The cross product satisfies the following properties, some of which were illustrated in Preview Activity or may be verified from the definition .   Properties of the cross product  Let , , and be vectors in , and let be a scalar. Then                   if and are parallel.    The cross product is not associative; that is, in general       While some of these properties may not seem natural, we need to look at these from the perspective of what we wanted the cross product to measure. The result of the cross product should complete a right handed coordinate system and the cross product should work well with linear combinations (distribute across vector addition and scalar multiplication). The first property above is a consequence of the cross product being the vector needed to complete the associated right hand coordinate system; If you switch the order of the first two vectors in our right handed coordinate system, then the third vector must switch direction in order for the orientation to follow the right hand rule. Properties 2 and 3 are exactly what we meant for the cross product to work well with linear combinations and can be verified algebraically from , and Property 5 should make sense in the context of Activity .    The Vector Nature of the Cross Product  The output of the cross product is a vector and thus has both magnitude and direction. In this section, we will split up the cross product's geometric meaning into these two fundamental properties of vectors. We will begin by first mentioning that the direction of the cross product (as defined in ) satisfies our claim in the introduction to this section.    The cross product of and is oriented to make a right handed coordinate system. In particular, this means that is orthogonal to both and .    Remember from Preview Activity that the cross product of and will complete the right handed coordinate system, . In particular, the last vector in our right handed coordinate system will be at a or angle to the other vectors because your thumb makes a angle with the plane that your fingers can extend and curl in. We defined the cross product to satisfy the right hand orientation relationship for , , and (and for linear combinations of these vectors), so we need only verify the orthogonal relationship algebraically by computing .   To summarize, we have , which implies that is orthogonal to . A similar algebraic argument will show that is orthogonal to , and thus the output of is a vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors, and . Because the cross product works well with linear combinations, is perpendicular to any linear combination of and (to be shown in ).    We now look at the magnitude of in terms of the vector attributes (magnitude and direction) of the input vectors and .    The length of the cross product of and satisfies where is the angle between and .    To investigate, we will compute the square of the length and denote by the angle between and , as in . The following simplification is not intuitive, but you can find through some significant algebra that Therefore, we have found .    Note that stated above implies if and are parallel. If and are parallel, then or , which implies that by Equation .    Applications of the Cross Product  Equation is also related to the parallelogram formed by two vectors and , as shown in Figure . We say that is the outward direction of the parallelogram formed by and if is perpendicular (in ) to the parallelogram and has a right hand orientation. You should now convince yourself that in the outward direction is coming directly out of the page (or screen). Remember that order of our vectors matters for orientation purposes, so the outward direction for the parallelogram formed by and would be into the page.   The parallelogram formed by and      The magnitude of the cross product, , is the area of the parallelogram defined by and . Additionally, is the outward direction for the parallelogram defined by and .    In general, the area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and height. Based on , we consider the base of the parallelogram to be and the height to be . This means that the area of the parallelogram formed by and is   Note also that if and are vectors in the -plane, then Equation shows that the area of the parallelogram determined by and is is the absolute value of the determinant . So the absolute value of a determinant of a matrix is also the area of a parallelogram.  The outward direction of the parallelogram is a consequence of .      Find the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors and .       The area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors is the magnitude of the cross product of the 2 vectors.   .  The magnitude is . The area of the parallelogram is 11.79.    Find the area of the parallelogram in whose vertices are , , , and .  It might be helpful to draw a picture to see how the vertices are arranged so you can determine which vectors you might use.      The vector that connects and is . The vector that connects and is .   .  The magnitude is . The area of the parallelogram is 1.41.    There is yet one more geometric implication we may draw from . Suppose , , and are vectors in that are not coplanar ( is not a linear combination of and ). Then, , , and define a three-dimension parallelepiped as shown in Figure .   The parallelepiped determined by , , and    The volume of the parallelepiped is determined by multiplying , the area of the base, by the height . As we have just seen, the area of the base is . Moreover, the height where is the angle between and the vector , which is orthogonal to the plane formed by and . Since is parallel to , the angle between and is also . This shows that and therefore   The cross product and the volume of a parallelepiped  The volume of the parallelepiped determined by , , and is .   As a dot product of two vectors, the quantity is a scalar and is called the triple scalar product triple scalar product .    Suppose and .    Find two unit vectors orthogonal to both and .       The cross product of 2 vectors is a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors. .  The magnitude of this vector is . Divide the cross product vector by the magnitude to get a unit vector orthogonal to and which is . The second unit vector is the opposite of this unit vector.    Find the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors , , and .       The volume of a parallelepiped is .    Find a vector orthogonal to the parallelogram containing the points , , and .       Two vectors between these 3 points are and . We need to find the cross product between these 2 vectors to fin an orthogonal vector .    Given the vectors and shown below in Figure , sketch the cross products and .   Vectors and     Sketch the cross product vectors   Sketch the cross product vectors    Are the vectors , , and in standard position coplanar? Use the concepts from this section to explain.   All 3 vectors lie in the same plane.   If we find the cross product and all 3 vectors are perpendicular to this vector, they will all lie in the same plane. Assume and lie in the same plane. The cross product of and is .  If is perpendicular to the cross product vector, the dot product between the vectors will be zero. . Therefore, all 3 vectors lie in the same plane.    We have seen that the cross product enables us to produce a vector perpendicular to two given vectors, to measure the area of a parallelogram, and to measure the volume of a parallelepiped. Besides these geometric applications, the cross product also enables us to describe a physical quantity called torque .  Suppose that we would like to turn a bolt using a wrench as shown in Figure . If a force is applied to the wrench and is the vector from the position on the wrench at which the force is applied to center of the bolt, we define the torque , , to be    A force applied to a wrench    When a force is applied to an object, Newton's Second Law tells us that the force is equal to the rate of change of the object's linear momentum. Similarly, the torque applied to an object is equal to the rate of change of the object's angular momentum. In other words, torque will cause the bolt to rotate.  In many industrial applications, bolts are required to be tightened using a specified torque. Of course, the magnitude of the torque is . Thus, to produce a larger torque, we can increase either or , which you may know if you have ever removed lug nuts when changing a flat tire. Increasing means you exert more force and increasing means you use a longer wrench. The ancient Greek scientist and mathematician Archimedes said: Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world. A modern spin on this statement is: Allow me to make large enough, and I shall produce a torque large enough to move the world.   When opening a door, you use the knob or push bar as far from the hinge as possible. If you were to try to open a door by pushing on the middle of the door (rather than the edge farthest from the hinges), you would need to push twice as hard normal because you have half of .    Comparing the dot and cross products  In this subsection we summarize the last few sections by comparing and contrasting several properties of the dot and cross products.    is a scalar, while is a vector.     , while      , while .     if and are perpendicular, while if and are parallel.       Object Types and Vector Notation  In this final subsection, we are taking some time to make sense of what kind of objects are described by different expressions involving vectors. It is very easy to get caught up in all of the manipulations of symbols and new operations and write an expression that looks reasonable but does not actually make sense. For example looks like a nice and reasonable calculation involving vectors (and looks a lot like the triple product...), but doesn't make sense because the quantity in the parentheses is a scalar and you can't take the cross product of a scalar and a vector.    In this activity, we are focused on the type of objects being used and whether the expression makes sense to do at all. We are not going to worry about interpreting or understanding what is being measured by these expressions.    For each of the expressions below, state whether the result will be a scalar, a vector, or the expression does not make sense. You should write a sentence or two about each to explain your reasoning.

You can use the sliders at the top of change how zoomed in the plot is displayed or change the location on the curve that you are examining. You should visually verify at a several points that this function is differentiable because at any point shown, the graph is locally linear.   A plot with the ability to zoom in on a point of , where is a nonlinear, differentiable function    Linear functions (of the form ) play important roles in single variable calculus and are useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will study curves in space and we will see that connection between local linearity and differentiability exists for curves in three (or more!) dimensions. Additionally, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.  Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space, as these correspond to graphs of linear expressions in and . (Recall that a function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less than or equal to 1. For example, defines a single variable linear expression and a two variable linear expression. But is not linear since it has degree two, the sum of the degrees of its factors.) We will study planes and lines in as flat graphs before we look at curves and surfaces in general. In your study of 1-variable functions, you probably worked with ideas like slope, direction, and measuring change using lines several times before you generalized those ideas for a curve in general. Similarly, we will want to have a good idea about how we talk about direction and measuring change along flat objects in (lines and planes) before we start generalizing to curved objects.    We will start our work on lines by considering some familiar ideas in but from a new perspective. You are probably familiar with equations of lines in the -plane in the form , where is the slope of the line and is the -intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines that is useful in the -plane and higher dimensions. To begin, consider the line through the point with slope as shown in Figure .   The line through with slope          Suppose we increase by 1 from the point . How does the -value change? What is the point on the line with -coordinate ?   As we increase by 1, the -value increases by . The point on the line with the -coordinate is .   If a line has a slope of , this means that an increase of 3 in the -direction results in increase of 2 in the -direction. If we scale this to a one-unit rate of change, an increase of 1 unit in the -direction results in an increase of in the -direction. From the point to the point with an -value of 3, this requires a 1 unit increase in the rate of change in the -direction, which results in an increase of in the -direction. Therefore, the point on the line with an -coordinate of is .    Suppose we decrease by 3.25 from the point . How does the -value change? What is the point on the line with -coordinate ?   As we decrease by 3.25 from , the -value decreases by . The point on the line with the -coordinate is .   If we decrease by from the point the -value will change by . Therefore, the point on the line with an -coordinate of is .    Now, suppose we increase by some arbitrary value from the point . How does the -value change? What is the point on the line with -coordinate ?   If we increase by an arbitrary value , the -value will change by . The point on the line with -coordinate is .   If we increase by some arbitrary value from the point , the -value will change by . The point on the line with -coordinate is .    Remember that the horizontal component of a vector describes the run and the vertical component measures the rise of the vector. So the slope of the line is related to any vector whose -component divided by the -component is the slope of the line. For the line in this activity, we might use the vector to describe the direction of the line. We will look at the following vector valued function of one variable: For each of the values of below, find and write your result as a single vector (of the form )           The terminal point of the vector is the point . Any vector that is a scalar multiple of has a slope of . If we start at the terminal point of , which is the point , and add scalar multiples of the vector , the terminal point of these scalar vectors will trace out the graph of the line through the point with a slope of .   The terminal point of the vector is the point . Any vector that is a scalar multiple of has a slope of . If we start at the terminal point of , which is the point , and add scalar multiples of the vector , the terminal point of these scalar vectors will trace out the graph of the line through the point with a slope of .    Draw the six vectors from the previous task in standard position (with initial point at the origin) on the plot below.   A blank 2D set of axes   A blank 2D plot where each coordinate varies from negative 10 to 10       Write a few sentence that compare the endpoints of your vectors from the previous task to the plot of the line through the point with a slope of ( ). In particular you should address what aspects of the line are related to or .       Lines in Space  The way most people draw a line is more connected to the ideas in than slope or algebraic forms. Take a minute and draw a plot of the line described by . You should not continue reading until you have made a plot (by hand) of that you would be proud to share with classmates.   A blank 2D set of axes   A blank 2D plot where each coordinate varies from negative 4 to 4     You may have done some algebra or other calculation to get to slope-intercept form or another familiar algebraic structure, but when you went to draw the line you almost certainly did the following steps  found a point to start your plot (maybe the y-intercept)  found a second point on your plot (perhaps using the slope to find the second point)  drew a line segment from the first point to the second, then extended the line past the second point to the end of you plot  went back to the first point and extended the line in the direction opposite of the second point  In other words, you made a starting point, extended indefinitely far in a particular direction, then added the opposite direction. This is the essence of the general description for a line we will give below.  In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set of points satisfying the equation for some constants and . The value of (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point is the -intercept and anchors the line to a location on the -axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to the vector , which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in Figure . Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point and a direction , as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space ( ) to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a line works in for any .   The line through with slope          A line line in space in space is the set of terminal points of vectors starting at a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector .    The vector in is called a direction vector line direction vector for the line. As we saw in Preview Activity , to find an equation for a line through point in the direction of vector , any vector parallel to will have the form for some scalar . So, any vector emanating from the point in a direction parallel to the vector will be of the form for some scalar (where is the origin).  In the figure below, you can use the slider to change the value of for this example line. You should pay attention to how changes as you vary .   A line in 2-space with vector definition      Figure shows the plot of a line in two-space in which we can identify the vector (going from the origin to our starting point ) and the vector as in Equation . Here, is the fixed vector shown in blue, while the direction vector is the vector parallel to the vector shown in red (that is, the red vector represents , and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the green vector). In other words, the tips (terminal points) of the green vectors (the vectors of the form ) trace out the line as changes.  In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in define a linear function in space of the following form, which is valid and gives some geometric intuition into each part for in any dimension.   The vector form of a line  The vector form of a line line vector equation through the point in the direction of the vector is where is the position vector from the origin to the point .     Lines in the -plane are commonly described using the slope-intercept equation . The vector form of the line, as described above, is an alternative way to represent lines that has the two advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines, whose slope is not defined, using a vertical direction vector. For example, the vertical line described by could be described in vector form with a direction vector like , giving . The second advantage of the vector form of a line is that this description of lines works in any dimension whereas the concept of slope of a line does not generalize to three or more dimensions.    Let's give a vector form of the line that is the -axis in . We need to pick a point on our line and a direction vector for our line. A convenient point would be the origin and we can use as our direction vector. This give a vector form of which can be combined to a single vector form of . This form should not be suprising since the -axis consists of points with - and -coordinates of zero while the -coordinate can be any real number.  We had many other choices we could have made for the initial point and the direction vector used to create the vector form of the -axis. We could have selected the point and the direction vector given by . While these are likely not choices you would have made, this point and direction vector still describe the necessary information to give the vector form of the -axis. The associated vector form of the -axis would be . It is unlikely that anyone else has ever described the -axis with this equation but the terminal points of the output vectors for do trace out the entire -axis.    If you wanted to look at a line that is less familiar you could select the line in that goes through and moves in the direction . The corresponding vector form would be given by . shows a plot of this line with a slider that you can use to change the value for and examine how the different aspects of this vector form look.   A line in 2-space with vector definition      You can pretty easily verify visually (using ) that , the line in that goes through and moves in the direction does not intersect the -axis. In two dimensions, two lines were parallel if they did not intersect but like slope this idea does translate to higher dimensions because is not parallel to the -axis. In general, two lines in are parallel if they can be described with direction vectors that are parallel. Remember that two vectors are parallel if they are non-zero scalar multiples of each other. This should make sense from the perspective that parallel lines should move in the same direction, but the same direction can be described by ANY parallel vector.       Let and and let be the line in through and . Note that Figure shows a similar example of a line in 3D defined by two points.    Give a direction vector for the line .   A direction vector for the line    The direction vector the for line is .    Give a vector equation of in the form .   A vector equation of is .   A vector equation of is .    Consider the vector equation What is the direction of the line given by ? Is this new line parallel to line ?   The direction of the line given by is .  This line is parallel to the line because the direction vectors are scalar multiples of one another.   The direction of the line given by is given by the vector that is multiplied by , which is .  This line is parallel to the line because the meaning the direction vectors are scalar multiples of one another.    Do and represent the same line, ? Write a couple of sentences to justify why you think and do or do not describe the same set of points.    and do represent the same line.   We know that the lines are parallel to each other from part . Now we need to see if they have a point in common, either or , by determining if there is a -value such that or .   .  Subtract from both sides to get . This equation is true when . Therefore, and are the same lines.      The Parametric Equations of a Line  The vector form of a line, in Equation , describes a line as the set of terminal points of the vectors . If and , then we can view this vector form in terms of components and get the following: Splitting this vector form into each component equation gives These equations describe the coordinates of the points on the line separately where each is coordinate is a function of . The variable represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a parameter . In particular, we use the following language.   The parametric equations of a line  The parametric equations for a line line parametric equations through the point in the direction of the vector are    We should note here that there are many different parametric equations for the same line. For example, choosing another point on the line or another direction vector produces another set of parametric equations. In many physical applications, it is useful to think of as a time parameter and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a particular way to walk along the line; there are, of course, many possible ways to walk along the same line. In mathematical terms, we say that the parameterization of a line is not unique.    Let and , and let be the line in through and , which is the same line as in Activity .    Find parametric equations of the line .       The vector form of the line was . This corresponds to the parametric equations of .    Does the point lie on ? If so, what value of results in this point?   No the point does not lie on .   Set each parametric equation equal to the corresponding component of the given point: . Solve each equation to get and . Therefore, the point does not lie on .    Consider another line, , whose parametric equations are What is the direction of the line ?   The direction of is .   To find the direction vector of , we look at the coefficients of the terms: .    Do the lines and intersect? If so, provide the point of intersection and the and values, respectively, that result in the point. If not, explain why. To find a point of intersection, you can set the coordinate equations of each line equal to each other try to solve for and .   Remember that the two lines need to go through the same point but do not need to have the same parameter value at that point (which is why we used different variable names for the parameters and ).    and intersect at    The direction vectors for lines and are not scalar multiples. Therefore the lines will intersect. We can set the corresponding parametric equations equal to each other than then use 2 of the equations to solve a system.   . Solve this system to get . Plug either of these values into the parametric equations for the corresponding line to get the point .    Before we move on to our discussion of planes in the next section, we will talk about some terminology that may helpful in describing features and measurements later. A line is a one-dimensional, flat graph in three (or ) dimensions. We say the line is a one-dimensional graph because there is only one direction to go and stay on the graph (forward\/backward). We say that a line is flat because the direction you are allowed to go doesn't change as you move along the graph. Note that flat does not mean horizontal. A circle would be another example of a one-dimensional graph that can be drawn in two or more dimensional space (because there is only one direction to move along the circle) but a circle is not flat since the direction you go to stay on the figure changes as you move along the graph. As we will see in the next section, a plane in three dimensional space is an example of a flat, two-dimensional graph. If you were an ant on a plane, you would have two dimensions you can move in while staying on the graph (forward\/backward or left\/right), but the direction(s) that the graph extends does not change when you move locations on the plane.    Summary    While lines in do not have a slope, like lines in they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector. Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.    Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line. In particular, the terminal points of the vector define a linear function in space through the terminal point of the vector in the direction of the vector , tracing out a line in space.        Rewrite the vector equation as the corresponding parametric equations for the line.

  "body": " Planes in Space     How is a plane defined in terms of measurements of points and vectors?    What different ways are there to determine a plane through geometric information?      In , we saw how to describe a line in by setting an initial point and allowing as much movement as you want in a direction given by the direction vector. In our preview activity, we will be looking at what happens when we allow only movement that is perpendicular to a given direction. Since we will specify the given direction by a vector, we will find the perpendicular directions using orthogonal vectors.    In this Preview Activity, we will be looking at what happens when we allow movement on a figure with the restriction that the movement must be orthogonal to .    Find values for and such that is orthogonal to .    Find values for and such that is orthogonal to .    Find values for and such that is orthogonal to .    Find two other values for each of and such that is orthogonal to .

You should put the component values of each vector into this array with each vector corresponding to a row.   A plot of your vectors that should be orthogonal to      Describe what you think the plot of the set of vectors that are orthogonal to will look like.      Planes in Space  Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions. In Section , we studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them. In particular, fundamental planes were of the form , like .   A plot of in red, in blue, and in green with a normal vector plotted for each fundamental plane    As shown in , any vector in a plane with will be orthogonal to the vector , any vector in a plane with will be orthogonal to the vector , and any vector in a plane with will be orthogonal to the vector . We will use this idea to define a plane in general.    A plane plane definition  in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector , as shown in Figure .     A plot of a plane with normal vector in red and vector on the plane in orange    Like the definition of a line, the definition of a plane given above uses a starting point and a vector as the critical pieces of information. For a line, you begin at the starting point and move as much as you want parallel to the given vector (the direction vector). For a plane, you begin at the starting point and move as much as you want orthogonal to the given vector (the normal vector). For a line, you move only in the direction of the given vector whereas on a plane you cannot move at all in the direction of the given vector.   This description of a plane allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that , , and that is an arbitrary point on the plane. Since the vector lies in the plane, it must be perpendicular to . This means that   The fixed vector perpendicular to the plane is frequently called a normal vector to the plane. We may now summarize our new equation for a plane.   Equations of a plane     The scalar equation of the plane plane scalar equation with normal vector containing the point is     The vector equation of the plane plane vector equation with normal vector containing the points and is       We may take the scalar equation of a plane a little further and note that since it equivalently follows that That is, we may write an equation of a plane as where .  Before we look at some examples, we will mention a few ideas that relate planes (as a collection of points), equations for these planes, and normal vectors for these planes. As we saw with lines and will see for most other types of graphs, there is not a unique way to give an equation for a plane. This highlights the difference between an equation that describes a graph and the set of points that make up the graph or make the equation true. For instance, and are different equations but describe the same graph (have the same set of points that make the equation a true statement.) You may be tempted to say Those are the same equations. They just differ by a scalar multiple! , but this difference is the same as the difference between parallel vectors.  The good news is that the orientation of a plane is encoded into the normal vector, thus we can use all the powerful tools we developed for vectors. We say that two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel (as vectors). In fact, we can describe the angle between two planes using normal vectors. The angle between two planes is the acute angle between their respective normal vector directions. While the angle between two vectors (as defined in ) can be obtuse, the angle between planes will not be greater than . When using normal vectors to describe the orientation of a plane (like when we want to measure the angle between planes), we need to consider all the vectors parallel to our choice of the normal vector because any vector parallel to our choice would give an equivalent equations for the plane. We will look at specifics of this in our next example.   If we would like to describe the plane passing through the point and perpendicular to the vector , we have or Notice that the coefficients of , , and in this description give a vector perpendicular to the plane.   A plot of a plane with normal vector in red and vector on the plane in orange    For instance, if we are presented with the plane we know that is a vector perpendicular to the plane.  Using our definition of parallel planes, we can see that our plane given by will be parallel to planes given by , , and because the respective normal vectors ( , , , and ) are all scalar multiples of each other.   A plot of three parallel planes with normal vectors    If we wanted to find the angle between and , we would need to consider the angle between the normal vectors and . The dot product of these normal vectors is , so the angle between these vectors is obtuse, but the (smallest) angle between the planes is NOT obtuse. The equation will describe the same set of points as but the normal vector for will be , which makes an acute angle with . So the angle between and is    A plot of planes and with normal vectors         Write a scalar equation of the plane passing through the point and perpendicular to the vector .            Is the point on the plane ?   No, the point is not on the plane .   Plug in to the equation of the plane. Does ? No, so the point is not on the plane .    Write a scalar equation of the plane that is parallel to and passing through the point . (Hint: Compare normal vectors of the planes.)       Parallel planes have the same normal vector: .    Write a parametric description of the line passing through the point and perpendicular to the plane described by the equation .       The normal vector of the plane is , which will be the direction of line .  The corresponding parametric equations are .    Find the point at which intersects the plane .       We need to plug in the parametric equations from into and solve for .   . Solve to get . Plug into the parametric equations to get the point of intersection .     Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three non-collinear points in space determine a plane. Consider three points , , and in space, not all lying on the same line as shown in Figure .    A plane determined by three points , , and    Notice that the vectors and both lie in the plane . If we form their cross-product we obtain a normal vector to the plane . Therefore, if is any other point on , it then follows that will be perpendicular to , and we have the equation:      Let , , and and let be the plane containing , , and .

For a second point on plane , choose any -coordinate and -coordinate, and then solve for the corresponding -coordinate. One such point with , and is     The angle between two planes is the acute angle between their respective normal vectors. What is the angle between planes and ?       The angle between the two planes is equal to the angle between the normal vectors. .      Summary    A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.    If , , and are non-collinear points in space, the vectors and and are vectors in the plane and the vector is a normal vector to the plane. So any point in the plane satisfies the equation . If we let , be the normal vector, and , we can also represent the plane with the equation         Find an equation of a plane containing the three points (-3, 3, -2), (-7, 1, -5), (-7, 2, -3) in which the coefficient of is -1.  = 0.               Find an equation for the plane containing the line in the -plane where , and the line in the -plane where .  equation:        Both lines are parallel to the -axis; thus our plane must have -slope zero. On the other hand, the line in the -plane is 3 units down and unit in front of of the line in the -plane; hence the -slope of our plane must be . Thus the equation is for some constant . Since the plane contains the point , the value of must be 3. So the equation is This is shown in the graph below.         Find the angle in radians between the planes and              The table below gives the number of calories burned per minute for someone roller-blading, as a function of the person's weight in pounds and speed in miles per hour [from the August 28,1994, issue of Parade Magazine ].  calories burned per minute    weight speed  8  9  10  11    120  4.2  5.8  7.4  8.9    140  5.1  6.7  8.3  9.9    160  6.1  7.7  9.2  10.8    180  7  8.6  10.2  11.7    200  7.9  9.5  11.1  12.6    (a) Suppose that a 160 lb person and a 200 person both go 10 miles, the first at 9 mph and the second at 8 mph.  How many calories does the 160 lb person burn?  How many calories does the 200 lb person burn?  (b) We might also be interested in the number of calories each person burns per pound of their weight.  How many calories per pound does the 160 lb person burn?  How many calories per pound does the 200 lb person burn?                       (a) The time in minutes to go 10 miles at a speed of mph is . Thus the 160 lb person going 9 mph uses calories, and the 200 lb person going 8 mph uses calories. (b) The 160 lb person burns calories per pound for the trip, while the 200 lb person burns calories per pound for the trip.        This exercise explores key relationships between a pair of planes.

Find a scalar equation for the second plane.    Find the angle between the planes, where the angle between them is defined by the angle between their respective normal vectors.    Find a point that lies on both planes.    Since these two planes do not have parallel normal vectors, the planes must intersect, and thus must intersect in a line. Observe that the line of intersection lies in both planes, and thus the direction vector of the line must be perpendicular to each of the respective normal vectors of the two planes. Find a direction vector for the line of intersection for the two planes.    Determine parametric equations for the line of intersection of the two planes.               .     .     .     .

  "body": " Common Graphs in Two and Three Dimensions     What are some sample graphs in two and three dimensions that can be used throughout our study of multivariable ideas?      In this section, we will introduce some examples of graphs in two and three dimensions that have nice algebraic properties and a variety of interesting geometric features. For our preview activity, we will recall some properties of graphs and equations that will be useful in describing our new examples. While students may have different levels of experience with graphs like circles, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas, we will focus our work on the correspondence between the algebraic presentations of these shapes and the important geometric features.    For each of the following equations, you should:   Find all -intercepts    Find all -intercepts    Identify the shape of the graph (if you know it)    Identify all points where the graph will intersect with the vertical line     Identify all points where the graph will intersect with the horizontal line                                                                 Coordinate Transformations  We have seen how the distance formula leads to the equation of a sphere and how the idea of flat one and two dimensional graphs gave rise to lines and planes. In this section, we will introduce some other curves and surfaces that will be used throughout the rest of this text as examples. These objects will allow us to have graphs with a variety of geometric features while still being algebraically simple. The next activity will go over a couple of basic coordinate transformation ideas that will be helpful in generalizing our common graphs.   Translation of Coordinates   In this activity we will look at how to translate coordinate systems, which means to use a new coordinate system with axes parallel to to the original set of axes and the same scale. In other words, the new coordinate system has a new origin but does not change the way coordinates are measured. This is very useful to simplify the equation of a graph by making the graph's center the new origin.    On the axes below, draw and label the point . With a different color, draw a new set of axes that are centered at and label these axes and . The and should parallel to the and axes and use the same scale.    Use the plot of the and axes above to give the -coordinates for each of the following points:      Remember that the locations of these points should not change, but rather the values of the measurements used to describe the location will change.    Generalize your work for and write and in terms of , , and the coordinates of new center .     Using the same coordinate systems as in , give the -coordinates of the following points:          Generalize your work for and write and in terms of , , and the coordinates of new center .       In this activity, we look at how transform the coordinates of points when changing the scale of your coordinate system.    While walking your dog, you notice that your dog takes three steps for every step of yours. When you sit down at home you realize that your coordinate system for your house is different than your dog's. You decide to make the origin of both your coordinate system and your dog's to be the entrance to your kitchen. Your dog's bed is eight of your steps south and four steps west of the entrance to the kitchen. The dog's water bowl is 5 of your steps north and 3 steps east from the entrace to your kitchen. The front door of your house is 15 of your steps south and 9 steps east of the entrance to the kitchen.  Draw a set of axes and plot the location of your dog's bed, water bowl, and the front door in terms of your steps from the origin (the entrance to your kitchen).    State what the coordinates of your dog's bed, water bowl, and the front door in terms of your dog's steps from the origin will be.    If your dog's favorite toy is 17 dog steps east and 5 dog steps north of the entrance to the kitchen and your dog's collar is 13 dog steps south and 7 dog steps west, give the coordinates of your dog's toy and collar in terms of your steps.    If you denote the coordinates in your steps the -coordinate system and your dog's steps with coordinates, give the location in both coordinate systems for your dog's bed, water bowl, the front door, your dog's favorite toy, and your dog's collar. Generalize your findings into equations that tranform between - and -coordinates.    The results of the previous activities are probably not suprising but should offer some insight into why some aspects of coordinate transformations seem backwards. This is because the transformations are about converting back to the measurement of a different coordinate system.    Conic Sections  You may have seen the ideas of coordinate transformation that were central to , but hopefully you see precisely where the algebraic transformations come from and how they correspond to simple geometric transformations. For our basic shapes in 2D, we will give a very brief definition for the shape, but the focus of this presentation will be about applying transformations to a basic shape in order to generalize the possible usage of these shapes.  A circle is the set of points that are a fixed distance (called the radius) away from a specific point (called the center). Most often, circles are introduced with the center at the origin and the radius given by a constant . This means that a point that is on the circle will satisfy which can be expressed as the equivalent equation Applying the same idea to a circle with center means you will get an equation like , which is often called the standard form of the circle. The standard form is convenient to use because the information needed to graph the circle can be read from this form without needing more algebra. For instance, the circle given by would have center and radius . Notice that the transformation equations from show up in this example as we move a circle from being centered at the origin( ) to a point ( ).    An ellipse is the set of all points such that the sum of the distances from the point to a pair of distinct points (called foci) is a fixed constant. In the interact below, you can use the slider to change the location on the ellipse being displayed. You should see how as you move around the ellipse, the sum of the lengths of the blue and red segments remains constant, as shown compared to the green segment (which is a fixed length).   A plot of an ellipse with foci in green      While the definition of the ellipse given above has some great applications in engineering, orbital mechanics, and optics, we will focus on the ellipse as a transformation of a circle. While this is not obvious and the details take a little while to prove, any ellipse in the plane can be obtained by transforming a circle (through translation, horizontal\/vertical coordinate stretches that are not the same as each other, and rotations of the coordinate systems).    What transformation is done to convert between the circle given by and the graph of ? You should be specific about how the graph of is different than the graph of .   Look at the -intercepts of each equation    What transformations are done to convert between the circle given by and the graph of ? You should be specific about how the graph of is different than the graph of and specify if the transformations need to be done in a particular order.    What transformations are done to convert between the circle given by and the graph of ? You should be specific about how the graph of is different than the graph of and specify if the transformations need to be done in a particular order.    Draw a plot of and label the center of your plot and the points that demonstrate how far the ellipse is stretched in the vertical and horizontal directions.    The graph of the equation is an ellipse. Convert this equation to the form and use the idea of transformations from above to graph this ellipse and label all extreme points on your plot.    The graph of the equation is an ellipse. Convert this equation to the form and use the idea of transformations from above to graph this ellipse and label all extreme points on your plot.    Give the equation of the ellipse shown in    A plot of an ellipse            A hyperbola is the set of all points such that the difference of the distances from the point to a pair of distinct points (called foci) is a fixed constant.   A plot of an hyperbola with foci in green    In the interact above, you can see how as you move around the hyperbola, the difference of the lengths of the blue and red segments remains constant (shown in green). Additionally, you can see that a hyperbola has asymptotic behavior in that as you approach the edges of the plot, the hyperbola will get very close to the asymptote lines (shown with a dashed line).      The most basic equation for a hyperbola is . Make a plot of the hyperbola given by . You should draw and label the asymptotes ( ) and the vertices,the points on the hyperbola that are closest to the center which are the -intercepts in this case.    What transformation is done to convert between the hyperbolas given by and the graph of ? You should be specific about how the graph of is different than the graph of .   Look at the -intercepts of each equation    What transformation is done to convert between the hyperbolas given by and the graph of ?

You should be specific about how the graph of is different than the graph of and specify if the transformations need to be done in a particular order.    Draw a plot of and label the center, the vertices of the hyperbola, and the asymptote lines. You will need to apply the transformations from the previous part to the asymptotes of the base hyperbola (given by ) in order to get the equations of the transformed asymptotes.    The graph of the equation is an hyperbola. Convert this equation to the form and use the idea of transformations from above to graph this hyperbola and label the center, the vertices of the hyperbola, and the asymptote lines.    The graph of the equation is an hyperbola. Convert this equation to the form and use the idea of transformations from above to graph this hyperbola. Remember to plot the vertices and asymptotes of the transformed hyperbola.    Give the equation of the hyperbola shown in    A plot of an hyperbola            A parabola is the set of all points that are the same distance from a point (called the focus) and a line (called the directrix).   A plot of an parabola with the focus in green and the directrix shown as a dashed line    In the interact above, you can see how as you move around the parabola, the lengths of the blue and red segments remains the same as each other. The point that is half way between the focus and the directrix is referred to as the center and the vertex of the parabola.      Make a plot of the parabola given by . You should draw and label the vertex and four other points on the parabola.    Draw a plot of the graph for and label the vertex and four other points. What transformation is done to convert between the parabola given by and the graph of ? You should be specific about how the graph of is different than the graph of .

Draw a plot of and label the vertex and four other points on the parabola.    The graph of the equation is an parabola. Convert this equation to the form and use the idea of transformations from above to graph this parabola. Be sure to label the vertex and four other points on the parabola.    Give the equation of the parabola shown in    A plot of an parabola            Cylinder Surfaces  Our previous examples in this section show how to create a variety of interesting curves on the -plane. What happens if we consider these same equations in three dimensions?   Let's look at an example like . If we consider the graph of in 2D, then we get a parabola centered at .   A plot of in the -plane with five points highlighted   A plot of in the -plane with five points highlighted      If we want to look at the graph of in 3D, we are considering all of the points that will satisfy this equation. So if we pick and values that satisfy , then ANY choice of will satisfy the given question. So for the each of the highlighted points on , we can extend the graph of parallel to the -axis. shows how the points on the parabola (in black) can be extended to include any coordinate.   A plot of generating curve and several rulings    Extending all points from the circle in the -plane parallel to the -axis will give a surface. This kind of surface is called a cylinder surface , the two dimensional curve you use to make the surface is called the generating curve , and the lines that extend in the direction of the missing variable are called rulings . In , the surface is plotted in blue, the generating curve in black, and the rulings in green. This surface is called a parabolic cylinder surface because the generating curve is a parabola.   A plot of the cylinder surface with generating curve and several rulings       Draw the graph of on the -plane.    Draw the graph of in -space. This is called a linear cylinder surface.    Draw the graph of in -space. This is called a right-circular cylinder surface.        A plot of the cylinder surface with generating curve and several rulings       Draw the graph of in -space. This is called an elliptic cylinder surface.    Draw the graph of in -space. This is called an hyperbolic cylinder surface.      Quadric Surfaces  In this section, we will look at a set of surfaces with algebraic equations that are quadratic in , , and . This will give us a category of example surfaces that are algebraically simple but exhibit a variety of interesting characteristics.    For this activity, we will be looking at a variety properties that will help us draw a graph of the surface described by .    Find all -, -, and -intercepts of .   The -intercepts are where and .    Find an equation for the curve given by the intersection of with the -plane. Draw a plot of this intersection on the -plane (this should be a 2D plot).

You can determine this by comparing the features on your previous part to these options.   A plot surfaces to select from      The surfaces given by , , and are examples of quadric surfaces . Quadric surfaces are the surfaces generated by polynomials that are quadratic in the three coordinate variables , , and . There are six main shapes of quadric surfaces; Below are plots of each of the main shapes with the algebraic form used to describe each shape. Note that all of these examples are oriented along the and centered at the origin, but in our later work, we will often consider versions of these oriented along other coordinate directions with the center not at the origin.   Quadric Surfaces  The following is a list of the six types of quadric surfaces and their general algebraic form centered at the origin with stretches of , , and in the respective coordinate directions. Each of these is oriented along the -axes (when possible).  Ellipsoid:   Hyperboloid of 1-Sheet:   Hyperboloid of 2-Sheet:   Elliptic Paraboloid:   Hyperbolic Paraboloid (Saddle):   Cone:       Quadric Surfaces    In , we will talk about surfaces where one coordinate can be expressed as a function of the others. This is an extension of the idea that graphs that pass the vertical line test can be expressed with as a function of . For instance, in the plot of the saddle surface , any vertical line (parallel to the -axis) will intersect the saddle surface at only one place, thus the saddle surface can be expressed with as a function of and . This is not surprising since the saddle surface is given by .  Compare this to the graph of a Hyperboloid of 1-Sheet in , where a line that is parallel to the -axis will intersect our surface at two places. Lines parallel to the - or -axes will also intersect the hyperboloid of one sheet in more than one place. This means that you cannot express the graph of a hyperboloid of one sheet with none of the coordinates as a function of the other two. Algebraically, this corresponds to there being more than one solution when you try to solve the equation for one variable. In particular, the multiple solutions come from needing to consider the positive and negative square roots. We will return to this idea in .    Summary    Translated Conic Sections have the following forms:  Ellipse: with center , vertices and covertices   Hyperbola: with center , vertices , and asymptotes   Parabola: with vertex\/center  Other versions of these forms that are oriented vertically will have the roles of and switched.    Cylinder surfaces are described algebraically by an equation involving only two coordinate variables. Geometrically, a cylinder surface is generated by a curve\/graph in the coordinate plane involving the two coordinate variables in the equation and stretching this generating curve parallel to the missing coordinate variable's axis.    Quadric surfaces are a category of surfaces created by quadratic equations in , , and . Quadric surfaces have six typical shapes: ellipsoid, hyperboloid of one sheet, hyperboloid of two sheets, elliptic paraboloid, hyperbolic paraboloid (saddle surface), and cone. The same coordinate transformations that generalize conic sections can be applied to quadric surfaces.         (a) Describe the set of points whose distance from the y-axis equals the distance from the xz-plane.    A cylinder opening along the y-axis    A cylinder opening along the x-axis    A cone opening along the x-axis    A cone opening along the y-axis    A cylinder opening along the z-axis    A cone opening along the z-axis    (b) Find the equation for the set of points whose distance from the y-axis equals the distance from the xz-plane.                              For each surface, decide whether it could be a bowl, a plate, or neither. Consider a plate to be any fairly flat surface and a bowl to be anything that could hold water, assuming the positive z-axis is up.                             Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section includes a lot of basic transformation ideas that students may have a range of experience with. We included these activities as a way to make sure that students have some exposure and they get to practice simple algebraic procedures that will be used with more complexity later in the text. A more thorough approach to the conic sections can be found at (insert link to IBL materials here). You may want to have students work through activities like and on their own during times where you don't have a preview activity to prepare for new material.   "

How can we convert coordinates of points or equations between rectangular and spherical coordinates?      In this preview activity, we will investigate some measurements that will be useful when defining new ways to specify locations. Many of these measurements involve measuring the length of specific line segments and angles between line segments in three dimensions.    An angle in the -plane is in standard position if the initial side of the angle is on the positive -axis and is measured with the positive direction going counterclockwise.    If an angle is in standard position, for which quadrants will the sine of be positive? For which quadrants will the output of sine be negative? What directions\/angles will corresponds to the output of sine being zero?    If an angle is in standard position, for which quadrants will the cosine of be positive?

A plot of point with , , and labeled      In this section we will define and work with a few new ways to specify the location of a point. These new measurements will be useful as coordinate systems and as a way of thinking about how to describe different shapes relative to rotational or other symmetries.    Polar Coordinates  We define the rectangular coordinates to be signed distances from the point to the axes as shown below. Remember that the sign on the coordinate tells you whether to go above or below the other axis.   A plot with the 2D coordinate measurements labeled   A plot with the 2D coordinate measurements labeled for a point in the first quadrant and a point in the fourth quadrant      We define the polar coordinates of a point in two dimensions to be , where is the signed distance from the origin to the point and is the angle from the positive horizontal axis and the line segment connecting the origin and . The angle is measured with the counterclockwise direction being positive. The sign on the will describe whether you need to move forward or backward when facing the direction.   A plot with polar coordinate measurements labeled   A plot with polar coordinate measurements labeled for a point in the first quadrant     A helpful way to visualize a location based on polar coordinates is to 1) stand at the origin, facing the positive horizontal axis, 2) turn (with positive being the counterclockwise direction), and 3) move in the direction you are facing.   Our first example will look at the location given by . To understand where this point is, we do the following steps: 1) go to the origin and face the positive -axis, 2) turn counterclockwise (to the positive axis), and 3) move two units.    Starting orientation of polar coordinates       Rotate by counterclockwise       Move two units in this direction       Geometrically, we can see that this location would have rectangular coordinates of . While geometry is useful for understanding meaning, it is rarely wise to compute things like coordinates using only a graph. In the next part, we will talk about algebraic tools that will allow us to convert between rectangular and polar coordinates.  If we considered the point with polar coordinates , we would do the following geometric instructions:    Starting orientation of polar coordinates       Rotate by clockwise       Move two units backwards while facing this direction       Notice that both and correspond to the location with rectangular coordinates . This example highlights how polar coordinates are measured and how there is NOT a unique set of polar coordinates for a location.    Converting between Recangular and Polar coordinates     Converting from Polar to Rectangular  If the polar coordinates of a point are , then , the rectangular coordinates of , satisfy     Converting from rectangular to polar  If the rectangular coordinates of a point are , then , the polar coordinates of satisfy assuming .      It is important to notice that the equations used in the conversion from polar to rectangular ( and ) work to convert coordinates of a point for any values of and , including negative -values and values of outside the interval . The conversion equations to go from rectangular to polar require you to interpret the results of your calculation because we are not able to solve explicitly for and in terms of and . This is because there is not a unique set of polar coordinates for a location. A point can have many different polar coordinates that refer to the same location.  For example, the point with rectangular coordinates can be given the polar coordinates or or or or or ... The good news is that when you need to choose appropriate and you can make proper choices based on your experience with quadrants and where the point is (in terms of and ).   In this example, we will look at how to convert the points with rectangular coordinates and into polar coordinates. Note here that is in the second quadrant and is in the third quadrant.  Using the conversion equations for , we see that which means we need to pick to be either . We will need to pick an appropriate angle for these possible -values that satisfy . There are angles in the fourth and second quadrants that will satisfy , namely and . You could also choose any angle coterminal to either of these angles. This is not a situation where any of the choices of will work with any choice of . We must interpret these choices together to get a description for the correct location.  If you want to choose then you will need to select the angle that corresponds to the second quadrant, , to get polar coordinates . If you wanted to not have to use the complementary angle to , you will need to use the negative value of to get .    A visualization of with polar coordinates       A visualization of with polar coordinates   A 2D plot of the point with polar coordinates      Now we will look at how to convert into polar coordinates. Similar to our arguments above, we find that implies that and . If we want to consider a positive value for and a value of between and , then we get and . We could also consider a negative value for and a value of between and , which would yield and .    A visualization of with polar coordinates       A visualization of with polar coordinates   A 2D plot of the point with polar coordinates      Remember that inverse trig functions have limited domains and ranges, the -coordinate can be positive or negative, and polar coordinates do not have unique values for a given point.     For each of the points listed below, you should:  Graph the point on a set of axes and label how each of the rectangular coordinates is measured.  Draw and label how the polar coordinates are measured for each point.  Compute the exact value of and for each point. Exact values include things like , , etc. You should simplify the trig function values of any common angles you encounter, like .

Draw and label how the rectangular coordinates are measured for each point.  Compute the exact value of and for each point. Exact values include things like , , etc. You should simplify the trig function values of any common angles you encounter, like .                               We now want to look at converting an equation between rectangular and polar coordinates. Remember that the graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the equation, so when we say that we want to convert an equation, like to polar coordinates, we meant that we want to find an equation in and whose graph will be exactly the same set of points as . This will be fairly easy because we have conversion equations that are solved explicitly for and ( and ) and do not require interpretation.   We can convert the equation to polar coordinates by substituting and to get So, the points that satisfy are the same locations as the points that satisfy . Except , we divided by , which will not give an equivalent equation if . Notice that if (or any integer multiple of ), then does not exist. So in a technical sense, we would either need to stop our algebra at or use a piecewise defined expression like This examples highlights the tricky part of converting equations; Without careful algebraic steps, you can miss points that need to be included in the graphs\/equations or possibly get nonsensical statements. Often we will use geometric intuition and information to help convert equations between coordinate systems and make sense of the resulting expressions.    In this example, we will convert the equation into rectangular coordinates, identify the shape of its graph, and plot the graph of this equation. Remember that we do not have explicit conversion equations for and , but we do have some equations, like which will allow us to convert to an expression in and that does not require intepretation. Let's try to square both sides of our polar equation, since this will give us an expression on the left hand side of the equation that will be easy to conver to rectangular coordinates. Our last equation is a mix of rectangular and polar coordinates so we are not done with our coversion to rectangular (just and ) coordinates. Unfortunately the easiest way to convert to rectangular is to use which will give us a rational expression for our conversion. This wil require some extra algebra and interpretation, so let's try a slightly different approach.  Instead of squaring both sides of our polar equation, what if we multiply both sides by . You may have seen this as a better approach from the start or gained this insight after our work above. Remember, there are multiple paths to insight and being able to incorporate new ideas and information to form new strategies is a vital skill to solving interesting and realistic problems.  So, if we multiply both sides of our original equation by , then we get This equation is great because both the left and right hand sides have conversions to rectangular coordinates that do NOT require interpretation or cases. So, the points that satisfy are the same locations as the points that satisfy .  We have now converted our polar equation to a rectangular equation. What shape will the graph of (or ) be? We can do some algebra (complete the square technique) to transform our equation into the the standard form of a circle ( ). We can see now that this circle will have center and radius . The graph of is the same as or which is plotted below.   A plot of   A plot of a circle with center and radius      While many people will find the rectangular equation more comfortable to graph and work with, this conversion from polar to rectangular is not always needed. You can find many resources on plotting points of a polar equation without converting to rectangular coordinates, especially when one coordinate (typically ) is solved explicitly in terms of the other coordinate.   You can see that both of the rectangular and polar coordinates of the points in , , and will satisfy the equations of . The plot below shows how you can visualize .   A plot of with the polar coordinate measurements of        The following activity will take you through how to create a graph of an equation in and .   Draw a graph of for at least .  For each value of listed below, compute the value of corresponding to .   Plot each of the eleven points you found in the previous part on the polar plane and connect them to make a plot of the graph of .    Graph the equation in the polar plane. You can use  Graph the equation in the polar plane.  What are the points of intersections for the graphs of and     For each of the equations given below, do each of the following:  Convert the equation to the other coordinate system (either rectangular to polar or polar to rectangular).  State the shape of the graph for the equation and any other information needed to graph  Graph the given equation and write a description for how the converted equation (from part a) makes sense in terms of your graph.                                    In , you saw how easy it was to read rectangular coordinates of a point when you had a rectangular grid. A polar point grid gives the same tools by plotting an array of constant coordinate graphs. An example of a polar grid is given below.   A polar grid (from https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Polar_coordinates_grid.svg)   (for accessibility)      Write a few sentences to describe what the graph of looks like, where is a constant. You should consider what values of will correspond to different shapes.    Write a few sentences to describe what the graph of looks like, where is a constant. You should consider what values of will correspond to different shapes.    The last idea of conversion we will look at between rectangular and polar coordinates is how to convert regions or inequalities between coordinate systems. Just as a graph of a an equation is a plot of the set of points that satisfies the equation, the graph of an inequality (or set of inequalities) is the region of points that satisfy the inequality.   The graph of the inequality is the vertical strip of points with horizontal coordinate between negative one and one (inclusive) and has graph given by   A plot of       If we consider the set of inequalities given by and , then we are looking for the region of points that satisfies both inequalities. The second inequality is shown in red on the left plot and the intersection of the two plots corresponds to the region described by and , which is plotted in blue on the right below.

Cylindrical Coordinates  We have encountered two different coordinate systems in , rectangular and polar coordinates, and seen how polar coordinates form a convenient alternative in certain situations. In a similar way, there are two more coordinate systems in that come from different ideas of rotational measurement. As we saw earlier, polar coordiantes will be an advantageous coordinate system when considering points\/graphs\/regions which have rotationally symmetric properties with respect to the origin. Given that we are already familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system for (from ), we will investigate cylindrical and spherical coordinates as ways to use angular measurements as part of our description for location in three dimensional space.   Cylindrical coordinates are a coordinate system for that consists of using polar coordinates, and , in place of and coordinates. Cylindrical coordinates are given in the order of and can be described as polar plus z . The coordinate is measured the same way as in rectangular coordinates (signed distance above or below the -plane) and polar coordinates are measured as a projection of the 3D point onto the -plane. To convert between rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, we use the same conversion equations as between rectangular and polar coordinates (in 2D).   A plot of point with , , and labeled      Converting between Rectangular and Cylindrical Coordinates     Converting from cylindrical to rectangular  If we are given the cylindrical coordinates of a point , then the rectangular coordinates of satisfy     Converting from rectangular to cylindrical  If we are given the Rectangular coordinates of a point , then the Cylindrical coordinates of satisfy assuming .        For our first example, we will look at the point with cylindrical coordinates . This point is shown in the figure below with the measurements of the cylindrical coordinates.   A plot of    To convert our cylindrical coordinates to rectangular, we can use and to get rectangular coordinates of .    In this example, we want to find cylindrical coordinates for the point with rectangular coordinates . Remember that just as the polar coordinates of a point in 2D are not unique, the cylindrical coordinates of a point in 3D will not be unique.  Using our conversion equations from rectangular to cylindrical, we get and . Remember that we must interpret the angle and our choice of to make sure our coordinates describe a point in the second octant. In particular, we will choose a positive value of which means we will need to select an angle of .  Alterntatively, we can use since will give an output of an angle in the first or second quadrants. You can verify that . So rectangular coordinates will coorespond to cylindrical coordinates of or .   A plot of      In our earlier work on polar coordinates, we saw how the graph of will be a line with slope . If we consider only positive coordinates then we get a ray with an angle of 2 radians from the positive -axis. If we wanted to consider the graph of using cylindrical coordinates (in 3D), then we get a plane that contains the -axis and goes in the direction. This is a cylinder surface with the line given by as the generating curve and rulings parallel to the -axis.   A plot of with positive values in blue and negative values in green      In this example we will convert the elliptic paraboloid given by to cylindrical coordinates. Algebraically, this is very simple because we can substitute to get . This should make sense for the graph of the elliptic paraboloid because the graph is rotationally symmetric around the -axis (which comes from not having an explicit dependence in the equation) and the height of the surface above the -plane increases quadratically as the location moves away from the -axis.

Draw a plot of the surface given by . Write a couple of sentences about the shape and properties of this surface.    Draw a plot of the region given by     These activities are meant not only to give you some algebraic experience with the cylindrical coordinate measurements, but also some examples where you can make sense of your results from a geometric perspective.    In this activity, we graph some surfaces using cylindrical coordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should first think about what each graph should look like before you plot it using appropriate technology.    What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates with , , and ? How does this example suggest that we call these coordinates cylindrical coordinates ? How does your answer change if we restrict to ?   In polar coordinates, the graph of is a circle centered at the origin with radius 2. Extending this to cylindrical coordinates, we obtain a cylinder centered at the origin of radius 2, with base on the -plane and height 2.    What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates with , , and ?   In polar coordinates, the graph of is a line through the origin making an angle of 2 radians with the positive -axis. Extending this to cylindrical coordinates,the graph of is a plane through the origin perpendicular to the -plane making an angle of 2 radians with the -plane.    What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates with , , and ?   The graph of is just a plane parallel to the -plane at a distance 2 above the -plane. With and , the graph of is just a disk of radius 2 centered at within the plane .    Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation , where and . What familiar surface results?   For a fixed value of , the graph of and is a circle of radius in the plane . As increases the radii increase, so we will obtain a cone with base at the origin, opening up with height .    Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation for . What does this surface look like?   For a fixed , the graph of is a line in the plane making an angle of with the -plane. Allowing to vary will produce a set of lines, spiraling upward so that the result looks like a bit of an auger.      Spherical Coordinates  Cylindrical coordinates used an angular measurement in the -plane as part of the description of location. Spherical coordinates uses one linear measurement and two angular measurements to specify the location of a point. The three measurements used to define the spherical coordinates of a point in are (rho), , and (phi), where  is the distance from the point to the origin  has the same interpretation it does in polar coordinates  is the (smallest) angle between the positive -axis and the vector from the origin to the point  as illustrated in Figure . You should convince yourself that any point in can be represented in spherical coordinates with , , and .   A plot of a point with spherical coordinate measurement     Coverting between rectangular and spherical coordinates     Converting from rectangular to spherical  If we are given the Cartesian coordinates of a point , then the spherical coordinates of satisfy where in the latter two equations, we require and .    Converting from spherical to rectangular  If we are given the spherical coordinates of a point , then the Cartesian coordinates of satisfy        In the following example, we investigate how to think about the spherical coordinate measurement of a point and how to convert between spherical coordinates and rectangular coordinates.   A plot of a point with spherical coordinate measurements    Consider the point whose rectangular coordinates are . What is the distance from to the origin? The result is the value of in the spherical coordinates of , so   In order to find the coordinate of , we will need to determine the point that is the projection of onto the -plane. Then, use this projection to find the value of in the polar coordinates of the projection of that lies in the plane. The projection of onto the -plane is the point . As we saw earlier with polar and cylindrical coordinates, we can use to find . For the point , . Remember that you must interpret the result of inverse trig functions according to the particular geometric situation given in the problem. In particular, but we want will need to interpret as a an angle in the second quadrant, we will use .  Based on the illustration in Figure , we can use the right triangle with sides that correspond to the measurement of , , and to find the angle . It may not be immediately clear where the angle is in this triangle, but shows how the alternate interior angles of the parallel lines (associated with will be equal. In other words, the upper right angle in our right triangle will be the same size as ).   A 2D plot of a point with spherical coordinate measurements in the plane of the measurement of      So we can calculate the -coordinate of using the property that , which means that .  The point with rectangular coordinates will be given by spherical coordinates of .     Use the conversion equations between rectangular and spherical coordinates to find the rectangular coordinates of the following points:               Draw each of the points from and show how the spherical coordinates of each point is being measured. You should use your plots to make sense of the rectangular coordinate measurements that were your answer to .     In this example we will look at converting equations and surfaces between rectangular and spherical coordinates. First, we will consider the surface defined by . Geometrically, we can think about as the set of points that are two units away from the origin, which creates a sphere of radius 2. Algebraically, we can square both sides of our equation to get and since , the spherical coordinate equation corresponds to the rectangular equation . In fact, for all positive values of , the surface will be a sphere of radius .  Next, we consider how to convert the equation of the half cone given by where to spherical coordinates. Algebraically, we can use a couple of ideas from our conversion equations that include and . Specifically, this means that Since we are considering the part of the cone with , we can use . This should not be that suprising that half cones centered on the -axis coorespond to a constant value of .  A plot of the half cone with measurement of shown in orange   If we considered the bottom half of the cone given by where , we would need to find the angle between and that satisfies . Using complementary angles we see that the bottom half of the cone given by where corresponds to the spherical equation .  A plot of the botom half of the cone with measurement of shown in orange    Finally, we consider how to convert the plane given by to spherical coordinates. We can use , , and to get the following set of algebraic simplifications: If the graph of seems unfamiliar, that is normal. This is not an expression you have (probably) seen before and does not simplify or offer geometric insight. This example shows how easily converting equations between coordinate systems without some geometric reasoning as to why can quickly turn into an exercise of algebra without much meaning.     For many students, the measurement of is the most difficult and most unfamiliar measurement for spherical coordinates. In order to help understand the measurement of the -coordinate, we will look at the collection of points described by a constant value of . For each of the equations below, you should:   Draw a plot of the points that satisfy that equation. For some equations, your plot will be a path in space and others will correspond to a surface. You should draw how the -coordinate is measured and related to the graph.    Write a sentence or two that describes the shape and features of your plot of the equation. You should mention any other descriptions that could be applied to your set of points, like axes or coordinate planes.                                  For each of the surfaces described below,  find a corresponding equation in spherical coordinates (involving only , , and ). You may want to consider algebraic or geometric approaches to these problems  draw a plot of surface and label any important measurements in terms of the spherical coordinates  write a sentence or two about the corresponding equation in spherical coordinates and any assumptions made in your work.      the xy-plane    the xz-plane          In this example, we want to visualize and go over some tips for thinking about the region given by the spherical coordinates , , and . We will look at these inequalities in sequence to figure out what the set of points that satisfies all three looks like. Our first inequality, , corresponds to all points in the first, second, fifth, and sixth octants. Many students draw this region with a spherical outer boundary, but with no restrictions on the other coordinates, your plot should emphasize that the region continues throughout all of these octants (without an outer boundary).   A plot of the region    We now want to think about the set of points that satisfy and . The region given by is the set of points between the spheres of radius 1 and radius 2 centered at the origin. So the region given by and is the region between the spheres of radius 1 and radius 2 centered at the origin with positive -coordinates.   A plot of the region and    When we consider the additional restriction of , then we get the part of the region (shown in ) that is also below the cone given by . This gives the region shown in . Note that we have shown each of the boundary surfaces in different colors so you can see how each of the upper or lower bounds on each of the coordinates gives rise to a different part of our region.   A plot of the region , , and       Draw the region described by and .    Draw the region described by with and     Give a set of inequalities in spherical coordinates that describes the points in the seventh octant.     For many people, the idea of lattitude and longitude are the most familiar use of spherical coordinates. In particular, if you look at a globe as a map of the earth, then you will notice a grid of lines that run from the top to bottom or around the globe (horizontally). These lines measure latittude and longitude of different locations on the surface of the Earth. This lattitude and longitude method of describing locations is actually spherical coordinates with a (slightly incorrect) assumption that the surface of the Earth is at a constant value of .  If you look at the lines of longitude and lattitude on a globe, you will see that these are actually angular measurements because each line in the grid is marked with a degree measurement. Lattitude describes how far a location is north or south of the equator and corresponds to a shifted measurement of the spherical coordinate . Specifically, a lattitude of corresponds to the equator, which corresponds to points on the surface of the sphere with . The location identified with the top of the globe is often called the North Pole and corresponds to a lattitude of North and a spherical coordinate measurement of . Similarly, the bottom of the globe is called the South Pole and corresponds to a lattitude of South and a spherical coordinate measurment of .  You can convert between lattitude and measurements by , where north lattitudes are considered negative and south lattitudes are considered positive.   A plot of lines of constant lattitude (in red) and longitude (in blue), with labels for the North and South Poles as well as the equator    The blue curves in are lines with constant longitude. Longitude corresponds to an angular measurement of how far around (horizontally) on the surface of the sphere. Longitude corresponds to a shifted version of the coordinate. Lines of Longitude are called meridians and the Prime Meridian corresponds to the meridian that goes through the Greenwich Naval Observatory in Greenwich England. If you were to flatten out the surface of the globe to make the lattitude and longitude lines form a rectangular grid, then you get a Mercator Projection map which you may recoginize. While these flat maps are convienent there is a considerable amount of distortion in these maps as you get closer to the poles. As you can see in , the lines with constant lattitude are NOT all the same length, but need to be stretched out considerably near the poles to get a nice rectangular grid, as in . Measuring the distortion of area (or volume) based on these coordinates will be an important idea in the later part of .   A Mercator projection of the Earth with lattitude and longitude lines By Strebe - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?curid=17700069      If we extended the grid of latitude and longitude to allow for multiple radii of spheres, we get a spherical coordinate grid as shown below in . You can see how visually cluttered this grid gets and why you will likely not see this idea used in plotting again.   A plot of a grid of spherical coordinates       Summary     The cylindrical coordinates of a point are where is the distance from the origin to the projection of onto the -plane, is the angle that the projection of onto the -plane makes with the positive -axis, and is the vertical distance from to the projection of onto the -plane.

  "body": " For many people, the idea of lattitude and longitude are the most familiar use of spherical coordinates. In particular, if you look at a globe as a map of the earth, then you will notice a grid of lines that run from the top to bottom or around the globe (horizontally). These lines measure latittude and longitude of different locations on the surface of the Earth. This lattitude and longitude method of describing locations is actually spherical coordinates with a (slightly incorrect) assumption that the surface of the Earth is at a constant value of .  If you look at the lines of longitude and lattitude on a globe, you will see that these are actually angular measurements because each line in the grid is marked with a degree measurement. Lattitude describes how far a location is north or south of the equator and corresponds to a shifted measurement of the spherical coordinate . Specifically, a lattitude of corresponds to the equator, which corresponds to points on the surface of the sphere with . The location identified with the top of the globe is often called the North Pole and corresponds to a lattitude of North and a spherical coordinate measurement of . Similarly, the bottom of the globe is called the South Pole and corresponds to a lattitude of South and a spherical coordinate measurment of .  You can convert between lattitude and measurements by , where north lattitudes are considered negative and south lattitudes are considered positive.   A plot of lines of constant lattitude (in red) and longitude (in blue), with labels for the North and South Poles as well as the equator    The blue curves in are lines with constant longitude. Longitude corresponds to an angular measurement of how far around (horizontally) on the surface of the sphere. Longitude corresponds to a shifted version of the coordinate. Lines of Longitude are called meridians and the Prime Meridian corresponds to the meridian that goes through the Greenwich Naval Observatory in Greenwich England. If you were to flatten out the surface of the globe to make the lattitude and longitude lines form a rectangular grid, then you get a Mercator Projection map which you may recoginize. While these flat maps are convienent there is a considerable amount of distortion in these maps as you get closer to the poles. As you can see in , the lines with constant lattitude are NOT all the same length, but need to be stretched out considerably near the poles to get a nice rectangular grid, as in . Measuring the distortion of area (or volume) based on these coordinates will be an important idea in the later part of .

  "body": " Vector-Valued Functions of One Variable     What is a vector-valued function? What do we mean by the graph of a vector-valued function?    What is a parameterization of a curve in ? In ? What can the parameterization of a curve tell us?      In our previous work we have seen several examples of curves in space, such as lines in three dimensions and conic sections (in 2D). Recall from that for a line through a fixed point in the direction of vector , we can express the line parametrically through the single vector equation   From this perspective, is a function that depends on the parameter and outputs a vector. When the output vectors are graphed with initial point at the origin, then the terminal points of this vector output will trace out the line in space, like . We call a vector valued function of one variable (or simply a vector valued function, for now) because there is one scalar input and the output is a vector that will vary based on the value of the scalar input.  Similar to lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects (there is only one way to move along this object, which we refer to as forward\/backward), and thus we would to similarly express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms of a single variable that could describe how we are moving along this path. For instance, the graph of an ellipse, like , cannot be expressed with as a function of , but curve of an ellipse is still a one dimensional graph because at any point on the graph, there is only one dimension to move (forward\/backward).  Vector valued functions (of one dimension) are a perfect vehicle for describing curves in general; we can use vectors based at the origin to identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us to draw an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to identify and describe curves in -space for any . This same approach to drawing curves will also allow us to represent traces and cross sections of surfaces in space, which we will discuss more in .    After graduating, you decide to start a self driving car company because it didn't look to hard based on a few articles you scrolled past online. You decide to call your company Steer Clear and start working on the self driving part of the car. Your first task is to understand how the location tracking equipment you bought online works. There are two components to your location tracking system. A receiver box and a tracker that you put in the object you want to track.    After putting the tracker in your pocket, you get in a car and drive around the receiver box. When you download the data about your drive, you notice that the software is outputting a vector from the receiver box to the tracker. The software also seems to love math, because these vectors are written in terms of trig functions.  Below are some of the output vectors from the software. Evaluate each of these vectors and draw each of these vectors with initial point at the origin on the same set of axes.          The first vector has an initial point of and terminal point . The second vector has an initial point of and terminal point . The third vector has an initial point of and terminal point . The fourth vector has an initial point of and terminal point .   The first vector has an initial point of and terminal point . The second vector has an initial point of and terminal point . The third vector has an initial point of and terminal point . The fourth vector has an initial point of and terminal point .    Below are a few more output vectors from your software. Evaluate each of these vectors and draw each of these vectors with initial point at the origin.         The first vector has an initial point of and terminal point .

In the preview activity, we saw how location data can be given by vectors with relative to a common point. In this section we will continue to look at the implications of using as a description of movement along a curve.    Vector-Valued Functions  As in Preview Activity , we can think of a point on the curve shown in Figure as resulting from a vector from the origin to the point. As the point travels along the curve, the vector changes in order to terminate at the desired point. shows a curve in space with a vector from the origin to a highlighted point on the curve. You can use the slider to change the location on the curve to see how changing a scalar (parameter) will give different outputs with terminal points on the curve.   A plot of curve in space     Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of vectors emanating from the origin. We therefore view a point traveling along this curve as a function of time , and define a function whose input is the variable and whose output is the vector from the origin to the point on the curve at time . In so doing, we have introduced a new type of function, one whose input is a scalar and whose output is a vector.  The terminal points of the vector outputs of then trace out the curve in space. From this perspective, the , , and coordinates of the point are functions of time, , say and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to represent the curve. The variable is called a parameter and the equations , , and are called parametric equations (or a parameterization of the curve ). The function whose output is the vector from the origin to a point on the curve is defined by      A vector-valued function (of one variable) vector-valued function definition is a function whose input is a real parameter and whose output is a vector that depends on . The graph graph of a vector-valued function definition of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.   Parametric equations parametric equations for a curve parameterization curve for a curve are equations of the form that describe the coordinates of a point on a curve in .    Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a vector-valued function of the form and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations for a curve. Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions as parameterizations in , , or any dimension. As a reminder, in Section , we determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a point and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in Figure has the parametric equations which is represented as the vector-valued function    Before we start working on parameterizations of curves, you may be asking yourself Why can't we just have the output of our function be a point? This is a good question because all things being equal, simpler tends to be better. But vectors have a LOT more tools and uses and we will use these vector tools throughout the rest of this course (and a few more) to make calculations easier and to make geometric sense of many measurements. For example, we used a (constant) vector to measure the direction a line moves and this vector is related to the location vectors along the path. Remember that we already have vector tools that allow us to separate measurements into different pieces (like magnitude or direction), or how much of a measurement is in a particular direction, or how much is orthogonal to another direction, or...    The same curve can be represented with different parameterizations. Use appropriate technology to plot each of the curves generated by the following vector-valued functions for values of from to . For each example you should write a few sentences to explain how the graphs are alike and how they are different.

This vector-valued function is a circle traced in the clockwise direction with radius , initial point , and terminal point . The circle is traced multiple times.      The examples in Activity illustrate that a parameterization allows us to look not only at the graph, but at the direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as changes. In the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can start at different points and move around the circle in either direction. In Section , we will begin to investigate the calculus of vector-valued functions, which will enable us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of an object moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the points on the curve itself, but also to describe how motion can occur along the curve.  In the next subsection we will cover some ideas that will be useful in parameterizing curves but first we will address a couple of ideas related to the new category of functions we will be studying. Remember that the big idea behind functions is that for each input there can only be one output assigned to that input. The domain of a function is the set of allowed inputs for the function. Sometimes a restricted set of inputs will be given that limits what inputs should be considered, but unless otherwise stated, the domain of a function will be the largest set of inputs for which the function is defined. Common ways for scalar functions to NOT be defined for a particular input include:  dividing by zero  taking the square root of negative numbers  restricted domains from other functions like or logarithms    The domain of of a vector valued function of one variable will the subset of where all of the component functions are defined. In other words, the domain of the vector valued function of one variable is the intersection of the domains for the component functions because that is the set of inputs for which the output will be defined.   For example, if , then the domains of the component functions will be , , and . For only the parameter values that all three component functions are defined will have an output. Thus the domain of will be .     Parameterizing Curves  In this subsection we will look at some examples related to parameterizing curves in space. A bigger idea that will be used throughout the rest of the text is the way that different relationships of between coordinates can be expressed or understood.  Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two dimensions is much more versatile than just defining as a function of . In fact, if is a function of , then we can parameterize the graph of by and thus every single-variable function may be described parametrically. In addition, as we saw in Preview Activity and Activity , we can use vector-valued functions to represent curves in the plane that cannot be described with as a function of (or as a function of ). (As a side note: vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions. To see how, if defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this function by . Since the inverse function just reverses the role of input and output, a parameterization for is .)   Parameterizing  In this example we will look at parameterizing the parabola given by . From , you can see that the graph of will pass the vertical line test, which means we can write the -coordinate as a function of the -coordinate. Specifically, we get . Using the idea above, we set to be our parameter, which means we can express both coordinates of points on our curve as a function of . In particular, will parameterize the parabola given by .   A plot of the parabola given by      Remember that there is NOT a unique way to parameterize a curve, so the choices above are not the only way to describe motion on the given parabola. You could move along the curve with double the speed (relative to the previous example), which would give .  Other choices for the parameterization might include wanting to center your parameter on the vertex ( corresponds to ), which could give a parameterization like . Remember that there is more than one way to walk the same path.     Vector-valued functions can be used to generate many interesting curves. Graph each of the following using an appropriate technological tool, and then write one sentence for each function to describe the behavior of the resulting curve.                   (Note that this defines a curve in 3-space.)    Experiment with different formulas for and and ranges for to see what other interesting curves you can generate. Share your best results with peers.          This function has an initial point of with a radius that increases as increase. This is a growing spiral in the -plane.    The domain for is . As increases, the -value keeps increasing in both the positive and negative directions. This is an expanding figure 8 like graph.    This function is called a Lissajous, or Bowditch, curve.    For , the function has -values between 0 and 1. For , the function has -values between -1 and 0. The function snakes its way outwards and then goes back to zero. It behaves similarily in the -direction.          This function has an initial point of with a radius that increases as increase. This is a growing spiral in the -plane.    The domain for is .

It behaves similarily in the -direction.       The intersection of surfaces in space are often curves and a convienent way of describing different conditions. Thus, we may determine parameterizations for these curves defined by satisfying multiple equations. For example, if , the intersection with the fundamental plane is given by setting in . We can then let be parameterized by the variable ; then, the trace is the curve whose parameterization is .    For this activity we will consider the paraboloid defined by .

As you saw in , it will be convenient to parameterize conic sections and other curves defined by common relationships between coordinates. In our next activity, we will generalize our work for parameterizing circles earlier to give a general parameterized of a translated ellipse. These ideas are extended in Exercises where hyperbolas and parabolas are parameterized.    Earlier we saw that to parametrize the implicit equation of a circle with center and radius given by we can use the relationship between and . We found a parametric equation for the circle can be expressed by The conic section most closely related to the circle is the ellipse. The general equation of an ellipse (centered at the origin) is given by   We can continue to make use of the relationship between and to discover parametric equations for an ellipse. In fact, without the and in the equation things would work perfectly. To remedy this (that is, get rid of ) we simply multiply by and by these values. Consider the equations    Substitute the equations for above into and simplify.  Consider the ellipse given by What are the parametric equations for this ellipse? Graph them below to ensure you obtain the exact same graph.

Set up a similar equation involving and then solve for to get a general set of parametric equations for the translated ellipse.     Summary    A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real parameter and whose output is a vector that depends on .

  "title": "Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions of One Variable",
  "body": " Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions of One Variable     What do we mean by the derivative of a vector-valued function and how do we calculate it?    What does the derivative of a vector-valued function measure?    What do we mean by the integral of a vector-valued function and how do we compute it?    How do we describe the motion of a projectile if the only force acting on the object is acceleration due to gravity?       In your first calculus course you looked at what was measured by the new operations of limits, derivatives, and integrals. Each of these ideas and its applications was likely introduced as a way to measure something specific by approximating the measurement and then looking at how to improve this approximation. Limits offered a powerful tool to precisely describe how these approximations would converge to the relevant measurement. This is the classic calculus approach: 1) approximate the measurement, 2) quantify how the approximation changes on a finer scale, and 3) use a limit to show how the approximate calculus converge to the measurement of interest.  In this course, we will use this structure to investigate properties of new kinds of functions, equations, and graphs. In this section, we want to investigate the meaning of limits, derivatives, and integrals on our new class of functions, vector valued functions of one variable. Additionally, we will connect these measurements to properties of curves in space as the graphs of these vector valued functions. As we expand our perspective and scope of study, you will likely see deeper meanings in the definitions of limits, derivative, and integrals from your first calculus course.    As the only employee of Steer Clear , you have decided that you need to understand how the timing of position measurements will change different measurements needed for your self driving car. You decide to drive in a figure eight path described by for . A plot of this path is given in .   A plot of the figure eight curve given by for        In order to understand how often to have your software collect location data, you decide to look at your position for a few different times. Calculate the following and draw the output vectors of on a plot of the curve. You should state your answer with components rounded to three decimal places.     These correspond to the locations that would be sampled if wanted to know the location of our car at but collected data every second, every tenth of a second, and hundredth of a second (respectively).    Write a couple of sentences to describe (geometrically and algebraically) what happens to the output of as .    Calculate and . Plot , , and on a graph of the figure eight curve.    Compute and explain how this calculation is different than the result of the previous step.    How would you expect to be different than . Use this idea write about what is measured by if we look at smaller and smaller values of . Remember to be specific about what aspects of our curve or drive are being measured.     In , we examined what the limit of a vector valued function will look like; specifically, the limit of a vector valued function (of one variable) has the same meaning as in your first calculus course. The limit of a function is a measure of what the output approaches as the input gets closer to a particular value. We will not state the formal version of limits of vector valued functions of one variable, but rather will appeal to the very important idea that limits can be defined and calculated componentwise. If , then the limit of as exists if all of the limits exist as . In other words, the limit of a vector valued function of one variable is the same as the limits of the component functions organized as a vector.    The Derivative  In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, , of a given function by provided the limit exists. At a given value of , measures the instantaneous rate of change of , and also tells us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point . The definition of the derivative extends naturally to vector-valued functions and curves in space.    The derivative vector-valued function derivative of a vector-valued function is defined to be for those values of at which the limit exists. We also use the notation and for .    We will take a moment here to note that both the single variable calculus definition of derivative and have form of the classic calculus approach described above. In particular, both definitions are of the form    Let be the vector-valued function whose graph is shown in Figure , and let be a scalar that represents a small change in time. The vector is the blue vector in Figure and is the green vector.   A single difference quotient of a vector valued function    If determines the position of an object at time , then represents the average rate of change in the position of the object over the interval , which is also the average velocity of the object on this interval. Thus, the derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of at time (for those values of for which the limit exists), so is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time . Furthermore, we can interpret the derivative as the direction vector of the line tangent to the graph of at the value .   Snapshots of several difference quotients as gets smaller        Similarly, is the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity of the object at time , for those values of for which the limits exists, and thus is the acceleration of the moving object.  Both the velocity and acceleration are vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction. By contrast, the magnitude of the velocity vector, , which is the speed of the object at time , is a scalar quantity.    Computing Derivatives  As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives using the definition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the limits and vectors make it straightforward to calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function similar to how we developed shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I. If we breakdown the steps in we notice that  vector subtraction ( )  scalar multiplication (multiply by )  evaluate limit as   are all evaluated componentwise on our vector valued function. Thus we can apply our derivative rules on each component of to compute the derivative .   Efficient calculation of the derivative of a vector-valued function   If , then for those values of at which , , and are differentiable.    To see why, recall that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and that we can remove constant factors from limits. Thus, as we observed after Preview Activity , if , it follows that Thus, we can calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function by simply differentiating its components.      For each of the following vector-valued functions, state any values of for which the limit will NOT exist, then find .    .     .     .     .         The third component of this function will only exist when and the limit of this function will exist if . Differentiating componentwise gives .    Each component of this function will have limits exist for every input. Differentiating componentwise gives .    The limit of the first component of this function does not exist for inputs of the form for . Differentiating componentwise gives .    Each component of this function will have limits exist for every input. Differentiating componentwise gives .      In first-semester calculus, we developed several important differentiation rules, including the constant multiple, product, quotient, and chain rules. For instance, recall that we formally state the product rule as   There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions, including a product rules for each of the kinds of multiplication we have defined involving vectors. These rules, which are easily verified, are summarized as follows.   Properties of derivatives of vector-valued functions  Let be a differentiable real-valued function of a real variable and let and be differentiable vector-valued functions of the real variable . Then                        .      When applying these properties, pay attention to whether the quantities involved as either scalars or vectors. For example, defines a scalar function because we have taken the dot product of two vector-valued functions. However, defines a vector-valued function since we have taken the cross product of two vector-valued functions.  In the next several sections of this chapter, we will examine how to utilize the calculus tools above and vector measurements to calculate different properties of curves in space and the associated velocity and acceleration vectors that come from their parameterizations.  I think the elements of the next activity are done other places in developing the splitting of acceleration. I think the calculation portions can be folded into the tangent line activity.    The left side of Figure shows the curve described by the vector-valued function defined by    The curve and its speed.         Find the object's velocity .    Find the object's acceleration .    Indicate on the left of Figure the object's position, velocity and acceleration at the times . Draw the velocity and acceleration vectors with their tails placed at the object's position.    Recall that the speed is . Find the object's speed and graph it as a function of time on the right of Figure . When is the object's speed the slowest? When is the speed increasing? When is it decreasing?    What seems to be true about the angle between and when the speed is at a minimum? What is the angle between and when the speed is increasing? when the speed is decreasing?    Since the square root is an increasing function, we see that the speed increases precisely when is increasing. Use the product rule for the dot product to express in terms of the velocity and acceleration . Use this to explain why the speed is increasing when and decreasing when . Compare this to part (d).    Show that the speed's rate of change is         Velocity is the derivative of position, so .    Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so .    Notice that , , and . The vectors at each point are shown in the figure below at left.    Speed is the magnitude of the velocity, so the speed of the object at time is . The speed of the object is at its least when . The speed is increasing on the interval and decreasing on the interval .      When in the position graph, the angle between and is larger than . When in the position graph, the angle between and is less than . Note that at the point when , the vectors and are orthogonal.    Using derivative properties we have . So the derivative of the speed is positive when is positive and negative when is negative. In other words, speed is increasing when is positive and decreasing when is negative. When in the position graph, the angle between and is larger than and so . When in the position graph, the angle between and is less than and so . Note that at the point when , the vectors and are orthogonal.    In general, if , then , , and the speed is . Recall that , so .        Tangent Lines  One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a differentiable function is locally linear : that is, when viewed up close, the curve generated by a differentiable function looks very much like a line. Indeed, when we zoom in sufficiently far on a particular point, the curve looks indistinguishable from its tangent line. You can look at at the beginning of for an interactive visualization of this idea.  In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be locally linear. In , we investigate how to find the tangent line to such a curve. Recall from our work in Section that the vector equation of a line that passes through the point at the tip of the vector in the direction of the vector can be written as   In parametric form, the line is given by     Let Sketch the curve using some appropriate tool and make a drawing by hand that labels the point at the end of .

The derivative is a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of at the point where .    Find the parametric equations of the line tangent to the graph of when .   Using the point and the direction vector found in (a) and (b), the parametric equations of the line tangent to the graph of when are .    On your plot of the curve , sketch the tangent line corresponding to and highlight the role of on your plot.   The sketch below shows the curve and a direction vector for the tangent line to the curve at .     We see that our work in Activity can be generalized. Given a differentiable vector-valued function , the tangent line to the curve at the input value is given by   Here we see that because the tangent line is determined entirely by a given point and direction, the point is provided by the function , evaluated at , while the direction is provided by the derivative, , again evaluated at . Note how analogous the formula for is to the tangent line approximation from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a given function at a value , we found that the tangent line can be expressed by the linear function whose formula is   Equation for the tangent line to the vector-valued function is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a single line, it is even possible to write the parameterization as (For example, in Equation , , so the line's parameterization starts at . When we write the parameterization in the form of Equation , , so the line's parameterization starts at .)  As we will learn in , a smooth surface in 3-space is also locally linear. That means that the surface will look like a plane, which we call its tangent plane , as we zoom in on the graph. It is possible to use tangent lines to traces of the surface to generate a formula for the tangent plane; see Exercise for more details.    Integrating a Vector-Valued Function  Recall from your calculus of scalar valued functions, that the definite integral of a function on the interval is defined as Where is the width of the interval from and is some point in . The definite integral measure the (signed) area between the graph of and the -axis between and . The definite integral follows our classic calculus approach to measure the accumulation of the output of over the interval . Most students never used this Riemann sum definition to calculate any definite integrals, rather they used the Fundamental Therom of Calculus and the associated antiderivatives to efficiently calculate the value of a definite integral. states that if is a continuous function on and is an antiderivatve of f ( ), then The set of functions that are the antiderivative of is also called the indefinite integral of and is denoted .  We can apply all of the ideas above related to definite and indefinite integrals to vector valued functions of one variable by performing each operation separately on each component (apply integration componentwise). Thus we   Integrating a vector-valued function  If , then Similarly, the indefinite integral vector-valued function indefinite integral  of a vector-valuedfunction is the general antiderivative of and represents the collection of all antiderivatives of and is denoted with An antiderivative vector-valued function antiderivative of a vector-valued function is a vector-valued function such that    The area under the curve idea does NOT generalize when we think about the integral of . The integral of is in relation to the variable and there is not a -axis on the graph of . need to think this explanation through more...  The concept that the definite integral measures the accumulation of the output of your function will generalize to the vector valued function realm. Recall that if was the velocity of an object traveling on the -axis, then we could describe the position of the object as This was the result of setting up a Riemann sum that looked at the change in position over a small step of time as the velocity on that step times the size of the time step. In other words,   Applying this accumulation of rates of change or velocity ideas componentwise means that if we are able to separate the velocity of our motion into components, then we can integrate (componentwise!) to get the position in terms of each coordinate separately! Additionally, we can integrate acceleration to get the velocity as a function of . Whether we are integrating velocity to get position or acceleration to get velocity, it will be necessary to have a particular point (in position or velocity) that will us to solve for the particular integration constant (the ).   For this example, we will look at the motion of a projectile in two dimensions where the only force on the projectile is gravity. This type of problem applies to sports like archery or shotput or to military applications like mortar or artillery placements, as well applications to firefighting or fireworks construction. This kind of simplified physics problem is common in introductory courses because there is only one force involved, the force is constant (does not change based on location, speed, or time), and the force is in only one coordinate direction. Even this description is a greatly simplified version of how gravity acts in a greater sense.  Newton's second law of motion says that that sum of the forces acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration vector. In our problem, the only force is gravity pulling the object in the negative -direction. In our example, we will try to completely determine the path traveled by an object that is launched from a fixed position at a given angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity. This information can be stated as follows:  the acceleration is given by (the only force is gravity pulling down with a constant force)  the initial position is  the initial velocity is     Projectile motion    We can simplify to get , then integrate acceleration to get the velocity as a function of . The indefinite integral of with respect to will be , where is some constant vector. We need to pick the constant such that the initial velocity is , so we will have   We can integrate our velocity function to get the position as a function of . The indefinite integral of will be Again we need to pick the integration constant, , that satisifes our initial position . This gives the following vector valued function for the position of the object as a function of time.    In the next activity, we will look at relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration in a situation that is more complicated than the constant acceleration of . The process of using integration and differentiation will remain the same but the results will not be nearly as simple.    Suppose a moving object in space has its velocity given by A graph of the position of the object for times in is shown in Figure . Suppose further that the object is at the point at time .    Determine , the acceleration of the object at time .   Since acceleration is the derivative of the velocity we have .    Determine , position of the object at time .   The position of the object is an antiderivative of the velocity, so for some constant . Since , we have and so . Therefore,     Compute the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of the object at time and plot these vectors using Figure .   The position graph for the function in Activity     The position , velocity , and acceleration vector of the object at time are shown below.     Give the vector equation for the tangent line, , that is tangent to the position curve at .   The vector is a direction vector for and so .    The situation in the previous activity shows a case where the motion of our object seems to be driven by forces with different behaviors that either turn the object or change the speed of the object in the -coordinate direction. We will spend the rest of this chapter looking at different measurements related to motion along curves like this. Key to these measurements will be the combined use of our new calculus tools for vector valued functions with the vector measurements from the previous chapter.    Summary    If is a vector-valued function, then the derivative of is defined by for those values of at which the limit exists, and is computed componentwise by the formula for those values of at which , , and are differentiable, where .    The derivative of the vector-valued function tells us the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to time, , which can be interpreted as a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of at the point , or also as the instantaneous velocity of an object traveling along the graph defined by at time .    An antiderivative of is a vector-valued function such that . The indefinite integral of a vector-valued function is the general antiderivative of (which is a collection of all of the antiderivatives of , with any two antiderivatives differing by at most a constant vector). Moreover, if , then     If an object is launched from a point with initial velocity at an angle with the horizontal, then the position of the object at time is given by provided that that the only force acting on the object is the acceleration due to gravity.

Use the value of you determined in (a) to find a vector form of the tangent line to at the point where .    Suppose that is a function that generates a surface in three-dimensional space, and that the curves generated by and both lie on this surface. Note particularly that the point of intersection you found in (a) lies on this surface. In addition, observe that the two tangent lines found in (b) and (c) both lie in the tangent plane to the surface at the point of intersection. Use your preceding work to determine the equation of this tangent plane.        We will need to find values of and so that , , and . The first equation tells us that .

Find all velocity vectors for the given acceleration vector . When you anti-differentiate, remember that there is an arbitrary constant that arises in each component.

  "body": " Arc Length     How can a definite integral be used to measure the length of a curve in 2- or 3-space?    Why is arc length useful as a parameter?      In the previous sections we have introduced the notation and graphs for vector valued functions, as well as how the calculus operations of limits, derivatives, and integrals will apply to these functions. In this section we will start our work on utilizing these calculus elements alongside our vector tools (like magnitude, direction, or projections) to measure important properties and find ways to efficiently calculate how these properties change along our curve. The first property we will investigate comes up very naturally when looking at curves in space: What is the length of a given curve in space? Remember that the distance between two points in space is given by The length of a curve is different than the displacement (change in position) as we will see in the Preview Activity.    In and we saw how the location tracking system's (LTS)output is related to a vector valued function that corresponds to how our car is being driven. In order to attract investors and drive shareholder value in Steer Clear , you decide to use the location tracking system's output to build a customized navigation and telemetry tool for a self driving car. The first element you will need to build is a way to use the LTS output to calculate how far the car has driven in a given time.    In your testing center, you drive your car up a parking ramp and note that the LTS recorded the car had coordinates of at and when . What is the distance between initial ( ) and final ( )positions of the car?    Do you think the distance the car actually traveled is greater than, less than, or the same as your answer to ? Write a couple of sentences to explain your reasoning.    In order to get more information for your telemetry system, you decide to pull the location data from your drive up the parking ramp every 10 seconds. The LTS gives the following data  at  when  when  when  Calculate the distance between successive times and estimate how far your car went in on the drive up the parking ramp.    Do you think your estimate from is greater than, less than, or equal to the actual distance traveled? Write a couple of sentences to explain your reasoning.    You look into the documentation on your location tracking system and see that you can specify how often to output the location data. You decide that getting the location every half a second seems like a good idea. How many data points will that correspond to for your drive up the parking ramp? Write a few sentences to describe what steps you would take with this new location data to calculate a better estimate on the distance traveled by your car.    The last task is an example of a vital skill mathematics, scientific, and engineering fields called algorithmic thinking. Algorithmic thinking involves breaking larger problems into different tasks where a precise set of rules or operations can be stated for each task. We have referred to our classic calculus approach in a few scenarios (and will again this section) and we will take a moment here to mention how the classic calculus approach has the structure of this algorithmic thinking. Specifically, the tasks for our classic calculus approach can be summarized as as 1) approximate, 2) quantify how approximation changes with scale or refinement, 3) apply limit to describe how approximation converges to the measurement of interest. The details of how each of these tasks is done will change depending on the measurement, which is why so much time will be spent talking about the details of tasks 1 and 2 when introducing new concepts.    Arc Length  The central question we want to answer in this section is Given, , a curve from to , what the length of ?    A curve oriented from the point to the point     An oriented curve from a point to a point     As suggested by our work in the Preview Activity and the classic calculus approach, we will approximate the length of the curve by computing the length of a collection of line segments between points on . In particular, we will call these intermediate points . Remember that we are specifying location using vectors to be graphed in standard position. Using vectors to specify position means that the corresponding line segments between successive positions can be represented by the vector difference .   A curve oriented from the point to the point split into parts with endpoints    An oriented curve from a point to a point     Notice that the description above does not involve a parameterization of or a description for how you are traveling along . In general, it is easiest to generate the positions by evaluating a parameterization at a different -values. In particular, we will use , a parameterization of to specify the points between and . Specifically, if is a parameterization of with and , then we divide into parts given by where with . This divides into parts that correspond to equal steps in the parameter which will not correspond to parts with equal length.  Our approximation of the length of will be the sum of the lengths of the vectors . The length or magnitude of will be given by the distance formula Our approximation of the length of the curve will be calculated by the sum of these lengths which gives   Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by the vector-valued function defined by  Preview Activity shows that to approximate the length of the curve defined by as the values of run over an interval , we partition the interval into subintervals of equal length , with as the endpoints of the subintervals. On each subinterval, we approximate the length of the curve by the length of the line segment connecting the endpoints. The points on the curve corresponding to and are and , respectively, so the length of the line segment connecting these points is   Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an approximation to the length of the curve:   We now want to take the limit of this sum as goes to infinity, but in its present form it might be difficult to see how. We first introduce by multiplying by , and see that   To get the difference quotients under the radical, we use properties of the square root function to see further that   Recall that as we also have . Since we see that is equal to   Noting further that we can rewrite our arclength formula in a more succinct form as follows.   The length of a curve  If defines a smooth curve on an interval , then the length arclength  of is given by    Note that formula applies to curves in any dimensional space. Moreover, this formula has a natural interpretation: if records the position of a moving object, then is the object's velocity and its speed. Formula says that we simply integrate the speed of an object traveling over the curve to find the distance traveled by the object, which is the same as the length of the curve, just as in one-variable calculus.    In earlier investigations, we have used integration to calculate quantities such as area, volume, mass, and work. We are now interested in determining the length of a space curve.  Consider the smooth curve in 3-space defined by the vector-valued function , where for in the interval . Pictures of the graph of are shown in Figure . We will use the integration process to calculate the length of this curve. In this situation we partition the interval into subintervals of equal length and let be the endpoints of the subintervals. We then approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with some related quantity that we can compute. In this case, we approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with the length of the segment connecting the endpoints. Figure illustrates the process in three different instances using increasing values of .   Approximating the length of the curve with , , and .          Write a formula for the length of the line segment that connects the endpoints of the curve on the th subinterval . (This length is our approximation of the length of the curve on this interval.)    Use your formula in part (a) to write a sum that adds all of the approximations to the lengths on each subinterval.    What do we need to do with the sum in part (b) in order to obtain the exact value of the length of the graph of on the interval ?        The length of the line segment connecting the points and is given by the distance formula .    We add the lengths given in part (b) to obtain the sum that approximates the total length of the graph of on the interval .    We must take the limit of the sum as goes to infinity.        Here we calculate the arc length of two familiar curves.   Use Equation to calculate the circumference of a circle of radius .    Find the exact length of the spiral defined by on the interval .         We can parameterize a circle of radius centered at the origin by for in the interval . The circumference of this circle is the length of curve defined by , or as expected.    The length of curve defined by on the interval is .      We can adapt the arc length formula to curves in 2-space that define as a function of as the following activity shows.    Let define a smooth curve in 2-space. Parameterize this curve and use Equation to show that the length of the curve defined by on an interval is     We can parameterize on by for in . Then the length of the curve defined by on is .      Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length  In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the expression for the length of a curve enables us to find a natural parametrization of space curves in terms of arc length, as we now explain.  Shown below in Figure is a portion of the parabola . Of course, this space curve may be parametrized by the vector-valued function defined by as shown on the left, where we see the location at a few different times . Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the curve.  A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve is the distance traveled as we move along the parabola starting at the origin. For instance, the right side of Figure shows the points corresponding to various values of . We call this an arc length parametrization .   The parametrization (left) and a reparametrization by arc length.    To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an interstate highway cutting across a state. One way to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a function . If we encounter an accident or road construction, however, this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our position on the highway. If we know how far we've traveled along the highway, we know exactly where we are.  If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can modify it to find an arc length parametrization, as we now describe. Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued function where is in the interval . We define the parameter through the function which measures the length along the curve from to .  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that and so   If we assume that is never 0, then for all and is always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we move along the curve.  Since is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means we may view the time as a function of the distance traveled; that is, we have the relationship . We then obtain the arc length parametrization by composing with to obtain . Let's illustrate this with an example.   Consider a circle of radius in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can parameterize this circle as where runs from 0 to . We see that , and hence . It then follows that   Since , we may solve for in terms of to obtain . We then find the arc length parametrization by composing   More generally, for a circle of radius centered at the origin, a similar computation shows that is an arc length parametrization.   Notice that equation shows that so which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parameterize by arc length. This is clearly seen in Example where . It follows that the parameter is the distance traveled along the curve, as shown by:     In this activity we parameterize a line in 2-space in terms of arc length. Consider the line with parametric equations    To write in terms of , evaluate the integral to determine the length of the line from time 0 to time .    Use the formula from (a) for in terms of to write in terms of . Then explain why a parameterization of the line in terms of arc length is          The length of the line from time 0 to time is .    We have , and so a parameterization for the line in terms of arc length is .      A little more complicated example is the following.    Let us parameterize the curve defined by for in terms of arc length. To write in terms of we find in terms of :   Since , we can solve the equation (or ) for to obtain . So we can parameterize our curve in terms of arc length by     These examples illustrate a general method. Of course, evaluating an arc length integral and finding a formula for the inverse of a function can be difficult, so while this process is theoretically possible, it is not always practical to parameterize a curve in terms of arc length. However, we can guarantee that such a parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role in the next section.  In the next activity, we will look at several measurements as we consider race car drivers completing one lap around the track seen in Figure .   A plot of the racetrack with scale in meters       All of the drivers in our race are going the same way around the track, all start at the same location at , all complete one lap of the track, and all of the cars have perfect grip of the road (the race cars are never sliding). The picture of the racetrack above is given so you have an example to help you think about the tasks in this problem, not because any particular feature of the track needs to be considered for the following activity.   Is it a property of the driver or the road?   In this activity, we want to determine if the different measurements that are described are a property of the driver or the road. A measurement is a property of the driver if the value(s) of that measurement can be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers must have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack).    Let's start by looking at a couple of easy measurements. Is the time elapsed a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.  Remember that we are NOT asking if the driver or road can control time. We are asking if the elapsed time is the same for all drivers at a fixed point on the racetrack or if drivers can have a different elapsed time to a particular location on the racetrack.   Is position (the location of the car on the racetrack) a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.   You should make sure you understand that the measurements for different drivers must be made at the same location on the track, as stated above. Your explanation sentence may sound a little silly.    Now that we are warmed up, let's look at some more interesting measurements.   Speedometer Reading : The car's speedometer reading measures how fast (as a scalar) the car is moving. Is the car's speedometer reading a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.    What vector calculus quantity is the speedometer reading?  The vector calculus quantities we have covered are time, position, velocity, acceleration, speed, arc length, unit tangent, unit normal, binormal, curvature, tangential acceleration component, normal acceleration component, and osculating circle. This is an easy one, I hope.    Odometer Reading : The racecar's odometer measures the distance traveled by the car. Every car's odometer is set to be zero at the start of the race. Is the car's odometer reading a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.      Summary    The integration process shows that the length of a smooth curve defined by on an interval is     Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.    We define the curvature of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or       The WeBWorK problems are written by many different authors.

  "body": " The TNB Frame     How can we measure the direction of travel on a parametrized curve?    How can we measure the direction of turning on a parameterized curve?    How can we measure the axis of rotation along a parameterized curve?      In , we saw how a vector-valued function of one variable will graphically correspond to a curve in space. While the application of derivatives, integrals, and limits apply to these functions componentwise, we will need to apply our calculus and vector tools together to measure important properties of these curves. Conceptually, you should think about the parameterization of the curve in space as a description on how to travel through those points in space. Remember that parameterizations are not unique; There is more than one way to walk the same path.   A plot of our racetrack    For example, consider the curve in space that we want a race track as shown in . Not every driver will travel along this racetrack in the same way, but every driver has to go through these same points in space (everyone will stay on the track and not take shortcuts). In the vocabulary of this chapter, any parameterization of this curve has to contain the same points, but can possibly go through these , , coordinates at different times. More generally, some properties you measure will depend on the particular way that a driver goes along the course and some properties will be the same for all drivers (when measured at the same location on the track).    Suppose that you are riding a bicycle along the path given below (with the direction given by the arrows). Notice that at points B and F the bike path crosses itself to go in a different direction.   The path of a bike ride with seven points labeled   The path of a bike ride with seven points labeled       At each of the points on the curve, draw a vector in the direction of travel.    At each point, decide whether the bike is turning left or right      Direction of travel  Based on our work in , if is a parameterization of a curve in space, then the velocity vector, , is in the direction of travel. Since the speed, , is not always 1 (the velocity is not a unit vector), we define the direction of travel as follows.    The unit tangent vector to a curve is denoted by is computed by and measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve.    From the definition, the unit tangent exists as long as the velocity exists and is not the zero vector. If the velocity vector is , then the object is not moving, thus the direction of travel would not make sense at that instant. If there is a jump or discontinuity in the derivative ( does not exist), the direction of travel at that instant does not make sense because there is not a consistent way to define motion.  The definition of allows us to separate the velocity into its magnitude (speed) and direction (unit tangent). Remember that changes along the curve and is calculated as a function of the parameter.   For our first example, we will look computing the unit tangent vector of a helix. In particular, we will look at the helix traced out by .   A plot of our racetrack    Based on our parameterization, we have velocity vector given by , which has speed given by One of the useful and unique ideas for this example is that we have a constant speed. No matter what time look at, the speed is always . Using , we can see that If we look at , then . If , then . In , is plotted in red and is plotted in blue. Both of these vectors are unit length and tangent to the curve in the direction of travel for that instant.   A plot of our racetrack    Note that we can also find by taking and shrinking to be a unit vector. We will often use this idea that because our definitions and theorems work for all -values, then we can apply them at a specific -value. This often has the added advantage that computations tend to be manageable to be done by hand because you are not concerned with how the measurement is done for every time.     Find , speed, and for a line given by the parameterization . Write a few sentences about why your results make sense and do not vary over time.    Find , speed, and for the curve given by the parameterization .    Find at the point if the tangent line to the curve through is given by .      The Direction of Turning  Recalling our analogy of our parameterization describing how someone drives along a racetrack, measures the direction that that car is heading in at any given instant. If we look at on our track, we see that . This is shown in . What direction is the car turning at ? You can see by the plot that the car will be be turning left, but that is a relative direction to the car. So how can we measure the direction that the car is turning at this instant, in terms of the -coordinate system?   A plot of our racetrack with plotted in red    Let's look at , which will measure how quickly is changing in terms of the parameter. Remember that vectors have magnitude and direction, so the derivative of a vector valued function of 1 variable will measure the change in the magnitude and change in the direction. Since will always have length 1 (when exists), all of the change in \\ will correspond to a change in direction. So the direction of will be exactly what we are looking for; namely, will be in the direction of turning. We don't care (for now) about how fast the car is turning, just what direction that turning is in. So we define the unit normal vector, denoted , as the unit vector in the direction of .    The unit normal vector to a curve is denoted by is computed by The unit normal vector measures the direction of turning along a parameterized curve.      Based on the definition of the unit normal, there are a few ways that will not exist. We will look at the meaning three different cases:  will not exist if does not exist  will not exist if does not exist  will not exist if       Draw an example of a curve such that does not exist at a point on your curve. Explain why does not exist based on your plot and explain why does not exist at the same point.    Draw an example of a curve such that does not exist at a point on your curve. Explain why does not exist based on your plot and explain why does not exist at the same point.    Draw an example of a curve such that at a point on your curve. Explain why based on your plot and explain why does not exist at the same point.     From our work in , we calculated Using the definition of , we need to compute the derivative of with respect to . Note that the derivative of is easily calculated for all time and this will rarely be the case. Further, making a unit vector in the direction of will be fairly easy and give us the following calculation:   We can calculate and . If we add these vectors to the plot of the helix with the Unit Tangent Vectors, as in , we can see that the direction of turning (as measured by ) is pointing toward the center of the helix. This should make sense the the direction you are turning is toward the inside of the circular trace. Note that the Unit Tangent vector has a vertical component because which corresponds to going up the helix but there is no vertical component to . This is because there is vertical motion, but there is no turning in the vertical direction. The z component of is unchanging so the vertical component of will be zero.   A plot of the helix with and plotted for a couple points    This example is the exceptional case where is easily calculated directly from the definition and the calculations are fairly clean. In the next activity, we will look at a curve with a simple polynomial parameterization that will demonstrate how easily the calculation of can go off the rails.     In general, calculating for all times ends up being very difficult because there are multiple compositions of functions involved which means there is a nesting of chain rules involved in the definition. In this activity, we will examine how to go through the direct calculation of for a curve parameterized by .    Given the parameterization, , calculate and .    and     Now calculate for the path.        We are going to take it slow and calculate the first component of . Remember that the derivative with respect to is computed componentwise.   The first component of is     Now calculate the second component of .   The second component of is     Now calculate the third component of .   The third component of is     Put together your work for the three components of and compute .    You likely gave up on the previous task or ran out of paper to write out and . Instead of more punishing algebra, describe how you would calculate if you had and .    As talked about in , the unit tangent vector, , measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve. The unit normal vector, , measures the direction that an object is turning (in order to stay on the curve). In , we saw that the unit tangent and unit normal vectors were orthogonal to each other (when measured at the same point).   Can have any part parallel to or must and be orthogonal?   By , the unit normal vector is parallel to . The derivative of the unit tangent vector will measure the change in , and since is a vector, this will include change in the magnitude and in the direction of . Since the length of does not change, then all of will have to be a change in the direction of and not at all in the direction of . This is an intuitive argument for why and are orthogonal.  (Maybe this becomes an exercise the way Steve did that) We can also give a more rigorous algebraic argument, but this argument does not provide insight into the measurements or relationship between and . For this argument, we will look at the derivative of . Because the length of is constant, then . To simplify , we will use properties of the dot product related to the magnitude, the derivative product rule (across the dot product), then the commutative property of the dot product, respectively. . If , then and are orthogonal. Since is parallel to , then and are orthogonal.    The Binormal Vector    The Binormal vector , , for a parameterized curve is defined as     This definition of creates a three dimensional right handed coordinate system that is relative to the motion along the curve. The Binormal vector will be a unit vector because where is the angle between and . Since and are unit vectors and orthogonal to each other, then . B will give the axis of rotation for the motion along the curve. Note that this measure of rotation follows our right handed measure of rotation. If you put the fingers of your right hand in the direction of travel ( ) and curl your fingers in the direction of turning ( ), then your thumb will correspond to the axis of rotation based on how you are moving along the curve.  This TNB frame is sometimes called the Frenet frame and is very useful in environments like aviation and space travel because so much of the relevant information needs be in terms of relative measurements to the craft and it's motion.   In this example, we will complete our calculation of the TNB frame for the helix given by . From and we have the following: Using the definition for , we get Factoring out from each component and simplifying the coefficient gives    A plot of the helix with the TNB frame plotted    Note that as you change the -value and move around the helix, the unit tangent points in the direction of travel, the unit normal points in the direction the object is turning (always to the left while going up the helix), and the Binormal vector is the axis of rotation for the and vectors. If you curl the fingers on your right hand from the direction of toward the direction of , notice that your thumb will point in the direction of . This sets up the TNB frame as a right-handed coordinate system that changes with the relative motion of the object.     The Driver or the Road: TNB Frame  In this subsection, we will talk about whether the measurements of , , and will be properties of the driver or the road. A parameterized curve also has a stated orientation (direction of travel). Remember that a measurement involving a parameterized curve is a property of the driver if two different parameterizations can have the different measurements at the same location on the curve. Remember that this does not mean that you look at the same parameter value on the curve, but rather the same location on the curve. A measurement on a parametertized curve is a property of the road if every parameterization of this curve must have the same measurement for a fixed location on the curve. This is the same ideas as was done in .     Direction of Travel : Each race car has a 1 meter arrow attached to the hood of the car which points straight ahead. This arrow will measure the three dimensional vector that is the direction of travel. Is the direction of travel a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.     Direction of Turning : The direction of turning is measured by checking to see if the steering wheel is turned left or right. We are not measuring how much the wheel is turned in either direction, just whether the wheel is turned left or right. If the steering wheel is not turned either way at instant we measure the direction of turning, then we say there is no direction of turning (because the car isn't turning at that instant). Is the direction of turning a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.    Is a property of the driver or the road? Justify your ideas.

  "title": "Splitting the Acceleration Vector",
  "body": " Splitting the Acceleration Vector     How can we split acceleration into the direction of travel and the direction of turning.      Velocity and acceleration are vital measurements in the study of physics and mechanics. Velocity is the derivative of position\/location (the central measurement of in kinematics, the study of motion). To understand velocity as a vector valued function of time, we looked at how the magnitude and direction of position change. In particular, we separated velocity into its critical parts, namely speed (magnitude of velocity) and unit tangent vector (direction of travel). Speed measures how fast the position of an object is changing as a function of time (as a scalar) and measures in what direction position is changing (measured with a unit vector).  Newton's Second Law of Motion relates the forces acting on an object to its acceleration through the formula , which is summarized as the sum of the forces acting on an object is the same as the mass times the acceleration of the object. We would like to understand acceleration as a change in the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. In this section we will use our knowledge of calculus and vector measurements to split the acceleration vector up into parts dealing with changes in he magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. Further, we wil make sense of these measurements in terms of thier physical meaning.

Splitting Acceleration  By definition (of ), recall that is parallel to (when not the zero vector or DNE) and that . In other words, all of the velocity is in a parallel direction to the unit tangent vector and the unit normal is always orthogonal to the unit tangent to a curve (when they exist). In this subsection, we will look at splitting the acceleration vector up into the direction of travel and the direction of turning.    The tangential component of acceleration is defined as and the normal component of acceleration is defined as . Because and are orthogonal to each other and unit vectors, and will give the amount of acceleration in the direction of travel and the direction of turning, respectively.    Given the definitions of and , can the acceleration vector of parameterized curve have any additional parts? Can have any component in another direction (like )? It is not obvious, but the answer is No! . The acceleration vector will only have components in the and directions. The scalar measures the acceleration due to change in the direction of and the scalar measures the acceleration due to the change in magnitude of . This interpretation of and follows from a neat product rule argument based on how we split the velocity vector into speed (magnitude) and (direction): The last line of this algebra follows from the definition of the unit normal vector ( ).  This algebraic splitting of acceleration gives a nice way to interpret . Specifically, is the rate of change of speed!  The scalar is much harder to interpret right now because our algebraic splitting above gives and (and ) are just as hard to calculate as directly (which is awful as shown in ). In the next section, we will address the meaning of a bit more, but for now you should think of as the acceleration due to a change in the direction of the velocity vector. In other words, is the amount of acceleration due to turning.    When we refer to the splitting of the acceleration, we mean that we want to explicitly describe how much of the acceleration is in the unit tangent direction and how much is in the unit normal direction (relative to the motion on the curve). In particular, we want to find and such that . Graphically, this will look like   A 2D curve with the splitting of the acceleration vector shown graphically        The tangential part of acceleration is defined as and our algebraic interpretation also gives us that . Using these formulas as a basis for your explanations, state whether can be zero or not. Either explain why this is not possible or what it would mean for to be zero.

In the context of riding a bike, how would you increase ?     In this example we will look at the splitting of acceleration for an algebraically simple curve traced by as goes from 0 to 2. We will first look at calculating the splitting of acceleration for all -values in our interval. In particular, we will calculate , , , , , and as functions of . The calculation of the velocity and acceleration are generally speaking the most familiar and as this example will show, it is possible to state each of our other calculations in terms of velocity and acceleration. The next quantity to calculate is . Note that for our example. This will allow us to calculate next from the definition   So far in this example, we have used the definitions to calculate both and , but is quite difficult to calculate using the definition. Our next couple of steps will use some vector calculations related to . Because the unit tangent and unit normal vectors are both length one and are orthogonal to each other, then . In particular, we can solve for which will not require an interpretation of positive\/negative because will always be non-negative. For our example, Note how we were able to find the acceleration in the normal direction ( ) by subtracting out the acceleration in the tangential direction. Our calculation above utilizes that is the length of this acceleration in the normal direction. The other side to this is that we can calculate as a function of without having to go through the difficulties involved in . Specifically, implies that . This is hugely useful because we were able to calculate everything on the right side of this equation in terms of and . For our example, Thus we can write as  While this process may seem a bit algebraically tedious, these steps are much less difficult than finding directly (as in ) AND we get insight into how the acceleration is split in the direction of travel and direction of turning. Graphically, we can represent this splitting with the following figure.  The curve given by with the splitting of acceleration shown graphically     In many circumstances, we need to compute the splitting of acceleration for only one time. For our example, we will look at how much cleaner the computations above will be if we want to look only at . The first steps for calculating and will be the same as before. You may want to go back and note that this was the only calculus done in the example above; all of our other steps were vector calculations and properties of orthogonal or unit vectors. We will follow the same method as above, but instead of applying these ideas for all -values, we will look only at . Remember if the formula we are using works for all , then the formula will work for a specific .   The next quantity to calculate is . Note that for our example. This will allow us to calculate next from the definition    We now use to efficiently calculate the normal component of the acceleration. We can now compute how much acceleration there is due to turning and use that explicitly compute . You can show that the length of is the same as our calculation for above. In particular, this means that Will some diligent computations, you should be able to verify that this result is the same as applying to our expression for from the first task.

Pedal Usage: We measure the pedal usage as either +, 1, or zero in the following way:  + if the gas pedal is being used  - if the brake pedal is being used  zero if no pedal is being used  Since our race car drivers are safety minded, they do not use more than one pedal at a time.

Our calculation above utilizes that is the length of this acceleration in the normal direction. The other side to this is that we can calculate as a function of without having to go through the difficulties involved in . Specifically, implies that . This is hugely useful because we were able to calculate everything on the right side of this equation in terms of and . For our example, Thus we can write as  While this process may seem a bit algebraically tedious, these steps are much less difficult than finding directly (as in ) AND we get insight into how the acceleration is split in the direction of travel and direction of turning.

  "body": " Curvature     How can you measure how fast a path is turning (regardless of the parameterization)?    What is the radius of curvature for a path at a given location?      We now have a way to measure direction of travel and direction of turning. speed will give us an idea about how fast we are moving along the curve, but we don't have a way to measure how much turning is happening at a given location. In this section, we will try to measure how quickly a path is turning   Draw curve with flat and tight curve. Draw T at P1 and Q1. Now draw T at P2 and Q2. Note that P1 and P2 are separated by the same amount of arc length as Q1 and Q2. Based on your T vectors, do youthink the direction of travel is changing faster at P or Q. Explain your ideas.   define curvature as the change in T in terms of steps in arc length  Given a space curve, there are two natural geometric questions one might ask: how long is the curve and how much does it bend? In this section, we answer both questions by developing techniques for measuring the length of a space curve as well as its curvature.    Curvature  For a smooth space curve, the curvature measures how fast the curve is bending or changing direction at a given point. For example, we expect that a line should have zero curvature everywhere, while a circle (which is bending the same at every point) should have constant curvature. Circles with larger radii should have smaller curvatures.  To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of the curve at a point. We may do this using a continuously varying tangent vector to the curve, as shown at left in Figure . The direction of the curve is then determined by the angle each tangent vector makes with a horizontal vector, as shown at right in Figure .   Left: Tangent vectors to an ellipse. Right: Angles of tangent vectors.       Informally speaking, the curvature will be the rate at which the angle is changing as we move along the curve. Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move along the curve; if we move with a greater speed along the curve, then will change more rapidly. This is why the speed limit is sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words, the rate of change of will depend on the parametrization we use to describe the space curve. To eliminate this dependence on the parametrization, we choose to work with an arc length parametrization , which means we move along the curve with unit speed.  Using an arc length parametrization , we define the tangent vector , and note that ; that is, is a unit tangent vector. We then have , which means that   Therefore   This observation leads us to adopt the following definition.    If is a smooth space curve and is an arc length parameter for , then the curvature curvature , , of is     Note that is the Greek lowercase letter kappa .      We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere. To show that our definition of curvature measures this correctly in 2-space, recall that gives us the arc length parameterization of a line. Use this information to explain why the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere.    Recall that an arc length parameterization of a circle in 2-space of radius centered at the origin is, from ,   Show that the curvature of this circle is the constant . What can you say about the relationship between the size of the radius of a circle and the value of its curvature? Why does this make sense?      We have .  So the curvature of a circle of radius is .  So, as expected, larger circles have smaller curvature.    The definition of curvature relies on our ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length. Since we have seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we would like to be able to express the curvature in terms of a more general parametrization .  To begin, we need to describe the vector , which is a vector tangent to the curve having unit length. Of course, the velocity vector is tangent to the curve; we simply need to normalize its length to be one. This means that we may take   Then the curvature of the curve defined by is   This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to calculate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.   Formulas for curvature  If is a vector-valued function defining a smooth space curve , and if is not zero and if exists, then the curvature of satisfies         .        Use one of the two formulas for in terms of to help you answer the following questions.   The ellipse has parameterization Find the curvature of the ellipse. Assuming , at what points is the curvature the greatest and at what points is the curvature the smallest? Does this agree with your intuition?    The standard helix has parameterization . Find the curvature of the helix. Does the result agree with your intuition?         We have and . So the curvature of the ellipse is given by . If we assume that , then we should expect that ellipse to have the largest curvature at the points and the smallest at the points (when for some integer ). The denominator of our curvature function can be written as . The curvature of the ellipse is largest when this denominator is smallest, or when or . These values correspond to the points . Similarly, the curvature of the ellipse is smallest when the denominator is largest, or when and . These values correspond to the points as expected.    Here we have and . Then and so .      The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the curve at that point. The curvature at a point on a curve describes the circle that best approximates the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius has curvature , then the circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose curvature is has radius and will be tangent to the tangent line at that point and has its center on the concave side of the curve. This circle, called the osculating circle of the curve at the point, is shown in Figure for a portion of a parabola.   The osculating circle      Summary    We define the curvature of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or       In this activity we will look at additional measurements and determine if these measurements are properties of the driver or properties of the road. This is a continuation of . As a reminder, a measurement is a property of the driver if the value(s) of that measurement can be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers must have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). The explanations for the next tasks may be difficult for you to write but will be very helpful in ensuring you understand the vector calculus concepts of this chapter.

Use to find for our function .    To find the center of the osculating circle, we will want to find a vector that points from a point on the curve to the center of the circle. Such a vector will be orthogonal to the tangent vector at that point. Recall that , where is the angle the tangent vector to the curve makes with a horizontal vector.

How do we find the distance between two points in ? What is the equation of a sphere in ?    What is a trace of a function of two variables? What does a trace tell us about a function?    What is a level curve of a function of two variables? What does a level curve tell us about a function?      Much of algebra, precalclus, and calculus has been focused on working with functions that have a scalar input and a scalar output. In previous chapter, we expanded this to address functions with a scalar input and a vector output. The calculus of these functions was not very interesting since we applied limits, derivatives, and integrals to these functions componontwise.  Many problems involve a much larger space of inputs and outputs. For instance, when studying weather patterns and behavior it is useful to measure temperature or atmospheric pressure. Both temperature and pressure are scalar measurements (measured by a single number) that will vary over three dimensions (north\/south, east\/west, and over elevation). Temperature can be given by a function with a location in three dimensions as the input and the temperature at that location (a scalar) as an output. Wind direction and strength are also very important when working with weather patterns. Wind is measured with a vector (magnitude and direction) and also varies with location in a three dimensional space. So wind would be given by a function with a location in 3D as an input and a vector as an output. We will look at the calculus of multivariable functions with scalar outputs (like temperature and pressure) in the next couple of chapters and will look at studying functions with multivariable inputs and outputs in the last chapter.  Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. Functions of several variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several variables.

If you invest dollars in the account, the amount of money in the account after years is given by   The variables and are independent of each other, so using functional notation we write    Find the amount of money in the account after 7 years if you originally invest 1000 dollars.

Functions of Several Variables  Up to this point we have been concerned with functions of a single variable. What defined such a function is that every input in the domain produced a unique output in the range. We saw similar behavior in Preview Activity , where each pair of inputs produces a unique output . Additionally, the two variables and had no real relation to each other. That is, we could choose any value of without considering what value might have, and we could select any value of to use without regard to what value might have. For that reason we say that the variables and are independent of each other. Thus, we call a function of the two independent variables and . This is the key idea in defining a function of two independent variables.    A function of two independent variables function of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair in some set exactly one real number .    There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of only two variables we can use any number of variables we like. For example, defines as a function of the three variables , , and . In general, a function of independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered -tuple in some set exactly one real number.  As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand the set of inputs for which the function is defined.    The domain function domain of a function is the set of all inputs at which the function is defined.      Identify the domain of each of the following functions. Draw a picture of each domain in the -plane.                                          and      or           There are no x or y values that make the function undefined, so the domain is all ordered pairs of real numbers.    The square root function is undefined for inputs that result in a negative radicand. Since , there are no that will result in a negative radicand. Therefore, the domain is all real ordered pairs of real numbers.    The rational function is undefined when the denominator is zero or undefined. The rational function is defined when . So and . Therefore, and .    The rational function is undefined then the denominator is zero or undefined. The denominator is only defined when . Therefore, or . But the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so the domain is all ordered pairs such that .         Representing Functions of Two Variables  One of the techniques we use to study functions of one variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a 2-dimensional table, where we list the -values down the first column and the -values across the first row. As an example, suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity) the horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial velocity the object is given, and the angle at which it is launched. If we let represent the horizontal distance the object travels, then is a function of the two variables and , and we represent in functional notation by where is the acceleration due to gravity. (Note that is constant, 32 feet per second squared. We will derive this equation in a later section.) To create a table of values for , we list the -values down the first column and the -values across the first row. The value is then displayed in the location where the row intersects the column, as shown in Table (where we measure in feet per second and in radians).   Values of .              25  7.6  14.0  18.2  19.5  17.8  13.2  6.5    50  30.4  56.0  72.8  78.1  71.0   26.2    75  68.4   163.8  175.7  159.8  118.7  58.9    100  121.7  224.2  291.3  312.4  284.2  211.1  104.7    125  190.1  350.3  455.1   444.0  329.8  163.6    150  273.8  504.4  655.3  702.8  639.3  474.9  235.5    175  372.7  686.5  892.0  956.6  870.2  646.4     200  486.8  896.7  1165.0  1249.5  1136.6  844.3  418.7    225  616.2  1134.9  1474.5  1581.4  1438.5  1068.6  530.0    250  760.6  1401.1   1952.3  1776.0  1319.3  654.3       Complete Table by filling in the missing values of the function .

If is a function of a single variable , then we define the graph of to be the set of points of the form , where is in the domain of . We then plot these points using the coordinate axes in order to visualize the graph. We can do a similar thing with functions of several variables. Table identifies points of the form , and we define the graph of to be the set of these points.    The graph function graph of a function is the set of points of the form , where the point is in the domain of .    We also often refer to the graph of a function of two variables as the surface function surface generated by . Points in the form are in three dimensions, so plotting these points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we use a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes the -axis, the -axis, and the -axis (called the coordinate axes ). As shown in Figure , we will use a right handed coordinate system for our plots. We can draw a graph of the distance function defined by . Note that the function is continuous in both variables, so when we plot these points in the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them all to form a surface in 3-space. The graph of the distance function is shown in Figure .   The distance surface.    There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces as indicated in the Preface (see Links to interactive graphics in Features of the Text). Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two independent variables, but not functions of more than two variables, we will primarily deal with functions of two variables in this text. It is important to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any number of variables.   Notation: We let denote the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers in the plane (two copies of the real number system) and let represent the set of all ordered triples of real numbers (which constitutes three-space).    Some Standard Equations in Three-Space   Activity showed that the equations where one independent variable is constant lead to planes parallel to ones that result from a pair of the coordinate axes. When we make the constant 0, we get the coordinate planes coordinate planes . The -plane satisfies , the -plane satisfies , and the -plane satisfies (see Figure ).   The coordinate planes.          Traces  When we study functions of several variables we are often interested in how each individual variable affects the function in and of itself. In Preview Activity , we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the amount initially invested and the duration of the investment. However, if we fix the initial investment, the amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the initial investment. This idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of several variables.  As another example, consider again the distance function defined by where is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, is the launch angle in radians, and is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at radians, we can consider a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have   We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when , as shown at left in Figure . The formula clearly shows that is quadratic in the -direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.  Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we can consider the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this case we have   We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when , as shown at right in Figure . The formula clearly show that is sinusoidal in the -direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity constant, the horizontal distance traveled by the object is proportional to the sine of twice the launch angle.   Left: The trace with . Right: The trace with .       The curves we define when we fix one of the independent variables in our two variable function are called traces .    A trace trace of a function of two independent variables and in the direction is a curve of the form , where is a constant. Similarly, a trace of a function of two independent variables and in the direction is a curve of the form , where is a constant.    Understanding trends in the behavior of functions of two variables can be challenging, as can sketching their graphs; traces help us with each of these tasks.    In the following questions, we investigate the use of traces to better understand a function through both tables and graphs.   Identify the trace for the distance function defined by by highlighting or circling the appropriate cells in Table . Write a sentence to describe the behavior of the function along this trace.    Identify the trace for the distance function by highlighting or circling the appropriate cells in Table . Write a sentence to describe the behavior of the function along this trace.

Contour Maps and Level Curves  We have all seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine Mountains in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in Figure . Map source: Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with permission of the Michigan DNR and Bob Wild. The curves on these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in elevation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if represents the altitude at the point , then each contour is the graph of an equation of the form , for some constant .   Contour map of the Porcupine Mountains.      On the topographical map of the Porcupine Mountains in Figure ,   identify the highest and lowest points you can find;    from a point of your choice, determine a path of steepest ascent that leads to the highest point;    from that same initial point, determine the least steep path that leads to the highest point.          The highest point is Summit Peak with an elevation of 593. The lowest point is in the upper left corner of the contour map with an elevation below 200.    From the chosen point, the steepest ascent will be in the direction perpendicular to the contour line with the next highest elevation.    From the chosen point, the least steep path will be in the direction that is closest to parallel to the contour line with the next lowest elevation.          The highest point is Summit Peak with an elevation of 593. The lowest point is in the upper left corner of the contour map with an elevation below 200.    From the chosen point, the steepest ascent will be in the direction perpendicular to the contour line with the next highest elevation.    From the chosen point, the least steep path will be in the direction that is closest to parallel to the contour line with the next lowest elevation.       Curves on a surface that describe points at the same height or level are called level curves .    A level curve level curve (or contour) of a function of two independent variables and is a curve of the form , where is a constant.    Topographical maps can be used to create a three-dimensional surface from the two-dimensional contours or level curves. For example, level curves of the distance function defined by plotted in the -plane are shown at left in Figure . If we lift these contours and plot them at their respective heights, then we get a picture of the surface itself, as illustrated at right in Figure .   Left: Level curves. Right: Level curves at appropriate heights.       The use of level curves and traces can help us construct the graph of a function of two variables.     Left: Level curves for .

The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves in space. In order to understand these traces and level curves better, we will first spend some time learning about vectors and vector-valued functions in the next few sections and return to our study of functions of several variables once we have those more mathematical tools to support their study.    A gallery of functions  We end this section by considering a collection of functions and illustrating their graphs and some level curves.                                                     Summary    A function of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs. The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.    In , the distance between points and (denoted as ) is given by the formula and thus the equation of a sphere with center and radius is     A trace of a function of two independent variables and is a curve of the form or , where is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.    A level curve of a function of two independent variables and is a curve of the form , where is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.        Evaluate the function at the specified points.   At :  At :  At :                  to find . Similarly, with we find . Finally, for we find .        Sketch a contour diagram of each function. Then, decide whether its contours are predominantly lines, parabolas, ellipses, or hyperbolas.                 SOLUTION  1. The contours have equation , which represent parabolas in the - plane.  2. The contours have equation , which (for ) represent ellipses in the - plane.  3. The contours have equation , which represent hyperbolas in the - plane.  4. The contours have equation . For , these equations are equivalent to , which represent vertical lines in the - plane.         Match the surfaces with the verbal description of the level curves by placing the letter of the verbal description to the left of the number of the surface.                          a collection of unequally spaced parallel lines    a collection of equally spaced parallel lines    two straight lines and a collection of hyperbolas    a collection of concentric ellipses    a collection of equally spaced concentric circles    a collection of unequally spaced concentric circles           The domain of the function is    A         Find the equation of the sphere centered at with radius 5.

A car rental company charges a one-time application fee of 30 dollars, 50 dollars per day, and 15 cents per mile for its cars.  (a) Write a formula for the cost, , of renting a car as a function of the number of days, , and the number of miles driven, .    (b) If , then                    A store sells CDs at one price and DVDs at another price. The figure below shows the revenue (in dollars) of the music store as a function of the number, , of CDs and the number, , of DVDs that it sells. The values of the revenue are shown on each line.   (Hint: for this problem there are many possible ways to estimate the requisite values; you should be able to find information from the figure that allows you to give an answer that is essentially exact.)  (a) What is the price of a CD? dollars  (b) What is the price of a DVD? dollars             , is linear and so we may write it as: where is the price of CDs and is the price of DVDs, in dollars. From the diagram, we can pick two points, such as , on the contour , and , on the contour . These points give the following system of linear equations: Solving gives dollars and dollars.        Consider the concentration, C, (in mg\/liter) of a drug in the blood as a function of the amount of drug given, x, and the time since injection, t. For mg and hours, we have    Give a practical interpretation of your answer: is   the concentration of a 5 mg dose in the blood 3 hours after injection.    the concentration of a 3 mg dose in the blood 5 hours after injection.    the change in concentration of a 5 mg dose in the blood 3 hours after injection.    the amount of a 3 mg dose in the blood 5 hours after injection.    the change in concentration of a 3 mg dose in the blood 5 hours after injection.    the amount of a 5 mg dose in the blood 3 hours after injection.                A manufacturer sells aardvark masks at a price of $180 per mask and butterfly masks at a price of $440 per mask. A quantity of a aardvark masks and b butterfly masks is sold at a total cost of $550 to the manufacturer.  (a) Express the manufacturer's profit, P , as a function of a and b .   dollars.  (b) The curves of constant profit in the ab-plane are   hyperbolas    parabolas    circles    lines    ellipses                Consider the concentration, , in mg per liter (L), of a drug in the blood as a function of , the amount, in mg, of the drug given and , the time in hours since the injection. For and , we have .  Graph the following two single variable functions on a separate page, being sure that you can explain their significance in terms of drug concentration.  (a)   (b)   Using your graph in (a) , where is  a maximum?   a minimum?   Using your graph in (b) , where is  a maximum?   a minimum?                        (a) Holding fixed at 3 means that we are considering an injection of 3 mg of the drug; letting vary means we are watching the effect of this dose as time passes. Thus the function describes the concentration of the drug in the blood resulting from a 3 mg injection as a function of time. The figure below shows the graph of . Notice that the concentration in the blood from this dose is at a maximum at 0.5 hour after injection, and that the concentration in the blood eventually approaches zero. The initial concentration is 0, so the minimum occurs at .  (b) Holding fixed at 0.5 means that we are focusing on the blood 0.5 hours after the injection; letting vary means we are considering the effect of different doses at that instant. Thus, the function gives the concentration of the drug in the blood 0.5 hours after injection as a function of the amount injected. The figure below shows the graph of . Notice that is an increasing function of . This makes sense: If we administer more of the drug, the concentration in the bloodstream is higher. In particular, this means that the maximum concentration occurs at the maximum value of , 4, and the minimum at .

(b) If is constant, we get , for some value of , so that the cross-sections are downward-opening parabolas. (c) If is constant and equal to 4, we get , which are two intersecting straight lines.

When people buy a large ticket item like a car or a house, they often take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the borrower has to make depends on the amount of money borrowed (called the principal), the duration of the loan in years, and the interest rate . For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula    Find the monthly payments on this loan if the interest rate is 6% and the duration of the loan is 5 years.

What techniques can we use to show that a function of two variables does not have a limit at a point ?    What does it mean for a function of two variables to be continuous at a point ?      In this section, we will study limits of functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of functions of two variables. In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite integral. In this section we will begin to understand how the concept of limit for functions of two variables is similar to what we encountered for functions of a single variable. The limit will again be the fundamental idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit of a function of several variables to define the important concept of differentiability later in this chapter. We have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in Section .  Let's begin by reviewing what we mean by the limit of a function of one variable. We say that a function has a limit as approaches provided that we can make the values as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . We denote this behavior by writing     We investigate the limits of several different functions by working with tables and graphs.   Consider the function defined by Complete Table .

Limits of Functions of Two Variables  In Preview Activity , we recalled the notion of limit from single variable calculus and saw that a similar concept applies to functions of two variables. Though we will focus on functions of two variables, for the sake of discussion, all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of any number of variables. In a natural followup to our work in Preview Activity , we now formally define what it means for a function of two variables to have a limit at a point.    Given a function , we say that  has limit as approaches provided that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . We write     To investigate the limit of a single variable function, , we often consider the behavior of as approaches from the right and from the left. Similarly, we may investigate limits of two-variable functions, by considering the behavior of as approaches from various directions. This situation is more complicated because there are infinitely many ways in which may approach . In the next activity, we see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.    Consider the function , defined by whose graph is shown below in Figure    The graph of .      Is defined at the point ? What, if anything, does this say about whether has a limit at the point ?    Values of (to three decimal places) at several points close to are shown in Table .   Values of a function .                                                     Based on these calculations, state whether has a limit at and give an argument supporting your statement. (Hint: The blank spaces in the table are there to help you see the patterns.)    Now we formalize the conjecture from the previous part by considering what happens if we restrict our attention to different paths. First, we look at for points in the domain along the -axis; that is, we consider what happens when . What is the behavior of as ? If we approach by moving along the -axis, what value do we find as the limit?    What is the behavior of along the line when ; that is, what is the value of when ? If we approach by moving along the line in the first quadrant (thus considering as ), what value do we find as the limit?    In general, if , then approaches as approaches , regardless of the path we take in letting . Explain what the last two parts of this activity imply about the existence of .    Shown below in Figure is a set of contour lines of the function . What is the behavior of as approaches along any straight line? How does this observation reinforce your conclusion about the existence of from the previous part of this activity? (Hint: Use the fact that a non-vertical line has equation for some constant .)  Contour lines of .           Since the denominator is 0 when , the function is not defined at the origin. However, a function can have a limit at a point where it is undefined, so this information does not determine if has a limit at or not.    It looks as though the values of are approaching different numbers (e.g., , , , ) as nears . The function will have a limit at the point if all of the values of the function become arbitrarily close to one fixed number as gets as close to as we want. Since the values of do not approach a single fixed number as gets close to , we should conclude that does not have a limit at .    When we have as indicated in the table. So .    When we have . So as illustrated in the table.    The fact that gets arbitrarily close to as gets as close to as we want and the fact that gets arbitrarily close to as gets as close to as we want shows that there is no fixed number that all of the values of approach as gets close to . So does not have a limit at .    When we have . If , then and if , then . In either case, the values do not all approach the same number as gets arbitrarily close to . In other words, has different limits along different paths that contain the origin.        Since the denominator is 0 when , the function is not defined at the origin. However, a function can have a limit at a point where it is undefined, so this information does not determine if has a limit at or not.    It looks as though the values of are approaching different numbers (e.g., , , , ) as nears . The function will have a limit at the point if all of the values of the function become arbitrarily close to one fixed number as gets as close to as we want. Since the values of do not approach a single fixed number as gets close to , we should conclude that does not have a limit at .    When we have as indicated in the table. So .    When we have . So as illustrated in the table.    The fact that gets arbitrarily close to as gets as close to as we want and the fact that gets arbitrarily close to as gets as close to as we want shows that there is no fixed number that all of the values of approach as gets close to . So does not have a limit at .    When we have . If , then and if , then . In either case, the values do not all approach the same number as gets arbitrarily close to . In other words, has different limits along different paths that contain the origin.      As we have seen in Activity , if approaches along two different paths and we find that has two different limits, we can conclude that does not exist. This is similar to the one-variable example as shown in Figure ; does not exist because we see different limits as approaches 0 from the left and the right.   The graph of .    As a general rule, we have   Limits along different paths  If has two different limits as approaches along two different paths, then does not exist.   As the next activity shows, studying the limit of a two-variable function by considering the behavior of along various paths can require subtle insights.    Let's consider the function defined by and investigate the limit .   What is the behavior of on the -axis? That is, what is and what is the limit of as approaches along the -axis?    What is the behavior of on the -axis? That is, what is and what is the limit of as approaches along the -axis?    What is the behavior of on the line ? That is, what is and what is the limit of as approaches along the line ?    Based on what you have seen so far, do you think exists? If so, what do you think its value is?    Now consider the behavior of on the parabola ? What is and what is the limit of as approaches along this parabola?    State whether the limit exists or not and provide a justification of your statement.         Along the -axis we have , so .    Along the -axis we have , so .    Along the line we have . So as goes to we have .    Based on the previous information, we might be tempted to say that has a limit of at .    Along the parabola we have . So as goes to we have .    Since has different limits along different paths that contain , we conclude that does not exist.        Along the -axis we have , so .    Along the -axis we have , so .    Along the line we have . So as goes to we have .    Based on the previous information, we might be tempted to say that has a limit of at .    Along the parabola we have . So as goes to we have .    Since has different limits along different paths that contain , we conclude that does not exist.      This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If we find two different paths that result in two different limits, then we may conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different paths.  Generally speaking, concluding that a limit exists requires a more careful argument.   Consider the function defined by We want to know whether exists.  Note that if either or is 0, then . Therefore, if has a limit at , it must be 0. We will therefore argue that by showing that we can make as close to as we wish by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . In what follows, we view and as being real numbers that are close, but not equal, to 0.  Since , we have which implies that   Multiplying both sides by and observing that for all gives   Thus, . Since as , we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close to (for this example, it turns out that we don't even need to worry about making close to 0). Therefore,    In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples illustrate some of the complications that arise when studying limits of two-variable functions, many of the properties that are familiar from our study of single variable functions hold in precisely the same way.   Properties of Limits  Let and be functions so that and both exist. Then     and       for any scalar                 if  .      We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus to verify that many limits exist. For example, these properties show that the function defined by has a limit at every point and, moreover,   The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have limits at every point.    Continuity  Recall that a function of a single variable is said to be continuous at provided that the following three conditions are satisfied:    exists,     exists, and     .     Using our understanding of limits of multivariable functions, we can define continuity in the same way.    A function is continuous continuity at the point provided that    is defined at the point ,     exists, and     .       For instance, we have seen that the function defined by is continous at every point. And just as with single variable functions, continuity has certain properties that are based on the properties of limits.   Properties of continuity  Let and be functions of two variables that are continuous at the point . Then    is continuous at for any scalar      is continuous at      is continuous at      is continuous at      is continuous at if       Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus to decide about continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate functions and defined by and are continuous at every point. We can then use properties of continuity listed to conclude that every polynomial function in and is continuous at every point. For example, and are continuous functions, so their product is a continuous multivariable function.    Summary    A function has a limit at a point provided that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to .    If has two different limits as approaches along two different paths, we can conclude that does not exist.    Properties similar to those for one-variable functions allow us to conclude that many limits exist and to evaluate them.    A function is continuous at a point in its domain if has a limit at and         Find the limits, if they exist, or type DNE for any which do not exist.   1) Along the -axis:  2) Along the -axis:  3) Along the line :  4) The limit is:                   dne       Determining the limit of a funtion   In this problem we show that the function does not have a limit as .  (a) Suppose that we consider along the curve . Find the limit in this case:    (b) Now consider along the curve . Find the limit in this case:    (c) Note that the results from (a) and (b) indicate that has no limit as  (be sure you can explain why!) .  To show this more generally, consider along the curve , for arbitrary . Find the limit in this case:    (Be sure that you can explain how this result also indicates that has no limit as .                  does not have a limit as approaches . (a) If tends to along the curve , then Therefore  (b) Similarly, if tends to along the curve , then and so Because we have two different values for these limits, we know that the function doesn't have a limit at . No matter how close we are to the origin, there will be points on that are close to and points that are close to , whereas for the limit to exist the function must get close to a single value. (c) We can see this more generally by considering the limit as tends to along the curve . Then so that and we see for every different value of we will get a different limiting value for the function. Thus the function does not have a limit at .        Show that the function does not have a limit at by examining the following limits.  (a) Find the limit of as along the line .    (b) Find the limit of as along the curve .    (Be sure that you are able to explain why the results in (a) and (b) indicate that does not have a limit at (0,0)!             (a) Let us suppose that approaches along the line . Then Therefore  (b) On the other hand, if approaches along the curve we have and so Thus no matter how close they are to the origin, there will be points such that is close to 0 and points such that is close to . So the limit does not exist.        Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type 'DNE' if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit (enter 'DNE' if the limit does not exist)  Hint: rationalize the denominator.

  "body": " First-Order Partial Derivatives     How are the first-order partial derivatives of a function of the independent variables and defined?    Given a function of the independent variables and , what do the first-order partial derivatives and tell us about ?      The derivative plays a central role in first semester calculus because it provides important information about a function. Thinking graphically, for instance, the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. In addition, the derivative at a point also provides the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to changes in the independent variable.  Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we can still ask how fast the function is changing, though we have to be careful about what we mean. Thinking graphically again, we can try to measure how steep the graph of the function is in a particular direction. Alternatively, we may want to know how fast a function's output changes in response to a change in one of the inputs. Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for addressing issues such as these. Preview Activity explores some issues with what we will come to call partial derivatives .

The quantity also tells us the slope of the line tangent to the graph of at .        First-Order Partial Derivatives  In Section , we studied the behavior of a function of two or more variables by considering the traces of the function. Recall that in one example, we considered the function defined by which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a projectile launched with an initial speed of feet per second at an angle radians to the horizontal. The graph of this function is given again on the left in Figure . Moreover, if we fix the angle , we may view the trace as a function of alone, as seen at right in Figure .   Left: The trace of with .       Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its derivative just as we did in the first semester of calculus. With , we have and therefore   When , this gives which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of Figure . Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous rate of change implies that if we increase the initial speed of the projectile by one foot per second, we expect the horizontal distance traveled to increase by approximately 8.74 feet if we hold the launch angle constant at radians.  By holding fixed and differentiating with respect to , we obtain the first-order partial derivative of with respect to . Denoting this partial derivative as , we have seen that   More generally, we have provided this limit exists.  In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, as shown in Figure .   The trace of with .       This gives and therefore   If we evaluate this quantity at , we have   Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right in Figure . Thinking of the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, we expect that the range of the projectile increases by 509.5 feet for every radian we increase the launch angle if we keep the initial speed of the projectile constant at 150 feet per second.  By holding fixed and differentiating with respect to , we obtain the first-order partial derivative of with respect to . As before, we denote this partial derivative as and write   As with the partial derivative with respect to , we may express this quantity more generally at an arbitrary point . To recap, we have now arrived at the formal definition of the first-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables.    The first-order partial derivatives of with respect to and partial derivatives first-order at a point are, respectively, provided the limits exist.      Consider the function defined by at the point .   Write the trace at the fixed value . On the left side of Figure , draw the graph of the trace with around the point where , indicating the scale and labels on the axes. Also, sketch the tangent line at the point .  Traces of .

On the right side of Figure , draw the graph of the trace with indicating the scale and labels on the axes. Also, sketch the tangent line at the point .    Find the partial derivative and relate its value to the sketch you just made.         Here we have . At the point where , the tangent line to this trace has slope , and so the line tangent to the graph of this trace at has equation .    We have . This is the slope of the line tangent to the trace at the point where , as calculated in part (a).    Here we have . At the point where , the tangent line to this trace has slope , and so the line tangent to the graph of this trace at has equation .    Now .

At the point where , the tangent line to this trace has slope , and so the line tangent to the graph of this trace at has equation .    Now , and so . This is the slope of the line tangent to the trace at the point where , as calculated in part (a).    Here we have . At the point where , the tangent line to this trace has slope , and so the line tangent to the graph of this trace at has equation .    Now , and so . This is the slope of the line tangent to the trace at the point where , as calculated in part (c).      As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as the derivative of a one-variable function defined by fixing one of the coordinates. In addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new function of the point , just as the derivative defines a new function of in single-variable calculus. Due to the connection between one-variable derivatives and partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style notation to denote partial derivatives by writing   To calculate the partial derivative , we hold fixed and thus we treat as a constant. In Leibniz notation, observe that   To see the contrast between how we calculate single variable derivatives and partial derivatives, and the difference between the notations and , observe that   Thus, computing partial derivatives is straightforward: we use the standard rules of single variable calculus, but do so while holding one (or more) of the variables constant.

Using the scalar multiple rule we have .    When we differentiate with respect to , we treat and as constants. So the scalar multiple rule give us . To differentiate with respect to will require the scalar multiple and chain rules, giving us . Similarly, .    When we differentiate with respect to , we treat and as constants. So the scalar multiple and quotient rules give us . To differentiate with respect to , we hold and constant to obtain and .        Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives  Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the line tangent to the graph at a given point. Similarly, we have seen that the partial derivatives measure the slope of a line tangent to a trace of a function of two variables as shown in Figure .   Tangent lines to two traces of the distance function.       Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall that the difference quotient for a function of a single variable at a point where tells us the average rate of change of over the interval , while the derivative tells us the instantaneous rate of change of at . We can use these same concepts to explain the meanings of the partial derivatives in context.    The speed of sound traveling through ocean water is a function of temperature, salinity and depth. It may be modeled by the function   Here is the speed of sound in meters\/second, is the temperature in degrees Celsius, is the salinity in grams\/liter of water, and is the depth below the ocean surface in meters.   State the units in which each of the partial derivatives, , and , are expressed and explain the physical meaning of each.    Find the partial derivatives , and .    Evaluate each of the three partial derivatives at the point where , and . What does the sign of each partial derivatives tell us about the behavior of the function at the point ?         The partial derivative is defined in terms of a change in per change in . So the units of are units of over units of , or .

That is positive tells us that if we increase the temperature from while holding the salinity constant at 35 grams per liter and the depth constant at 100 meters, the speed of sound in the ocean increases. Similarly, the fact that is positive tells us that if we increase salinity from 35 grams per liter while holding the the temperature constant at and the depth constant at 100 meters, the speed of sound in the ocean increases. Also, the fact that is positive tells us that if we increase depth from 100 meters while holding the the temperature constant at and the salinity constant at 35 grams per liter, the speed of sound in the ocean increases.

Similarly, the fact that is positive tells us that if we increase salinity from 35 grams per liter while holding the the temperature constant at and the depth constant at 100 meters, the speed of sound in the ocean increases. Also, the fact that is positive tells us that if we increase depth from 100 meters while holding the the temperature constant at and the salinity constant at 35 grams per liter, the speed of sound in the ocean increases.        Using tables and contours to estimate partial derivatives  Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either a table of data or a contour plot. In single variable calculus, we saw how we can use the difference quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic formula, we only know the value of the function at a few points. The same idea applies to partial derivatives.    The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how cold it feels outside when the wind is blowing. In Table , the wind chill , measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed , measured in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature , also measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We thus view as being of the form .   Wind chill as a function of wind speed and temperature.

This is the symmetric difference quotient from calculus 1. The data in our table allows us to use for wind speed, so degrees Fahrenheit per mile per hour. So for every one mile per hour increase in the wind speed from 20 miles per hour, while holding the air temperature constant at , the wind chill decreases by approximately 0.5 .    We approximate in the same way, using again. So degrees Fahrenheit per degree Fahrenheit. So for every one degree Fahrenheit increase in the wind temperature , while holding the wind speed constant at 20 miles per hour, the wind chill increases by approximately 1.3 .    This is just like a linearization from calculus 1 along the trace with . We found the slope of the tangent line to the trace of at the point to be , so .

In Preview Activity and Activity , you may have noticed that the mixed second-order partial derivatives are equal. This observation holds generally and is known as Clairaut's Theorem.   Clairaut's Theorem  Let be a function of several variables for which the partial derivatives and are continuous near the point . Then      Interpreting the Second-Order Partial Derivatives  Recall from single variable calculus that the second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the derivative. This observation is the key to understanding the meaning of the second-order partial derivatives.   The tangent lines to a trace with increasing .        Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a point provides us with information about the concavity of the function at that point. Since the unmixed second-order partial derivative requires us to hold constant and differentiate twice with respect to , we may simply view as the second derivative of a trace of where is fixed. As such, will measure the concavity of this trace.  Consider, for example, . Figure shows the graph of this function along with the trace given by . Also shown are three tangent lines to this trace, with increasing -values from left to right among the three plots in Figure .  That the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as increases is reflected, as it is in one-variable calculus, in the fact that the trace is concave down. Indeed, we see that and so , since for all values of , including .  In the following activity, we further explore what second-order partial derivatives tell us about the geometric behavior of a surface.    We continue to consider the function defined by .   In Figure , we see the trace of that has held constant with . We also see three different lines that are tangent to the trace of in the direction at values of that are increasing from left to right in the figure. Write a couple of sentences that describe whether the slope of the tangent lines to this curve increase or decrease as increases, and, after computing , explain how this observation is related to the value of . Be sure to address the notion of concavity in your response.(You need to be careful about the directions in which and are increasing.)  The tangent lines to a trace with increasing .           In Figure , we start to think about the mixed partial derivative, . Here, we first hold constant to generate the first-order partial derivative , and then we hold constant to compute . This leads to first thinking about a trace with being constant, followed by slopes of tangent lines in the -direction that slide along the original trace. You might think of sliding your pencil down the trace with constant in a way that its slope indicates in order to further animate the three snapshots shown in the figure.  The trace of with , along with tangent lines in the -direction at three different points.         Based on Figure , is positive or negative? Why?    Determine the formula for , and hence evaluate . How does this value compare with your observations in (b)?    We know that measures the concavity of the trace, and that measures the concavity of the trace. What do you think the quantity measures?    On Figure , sketch the trace with , and sketch three tangent lines whose slopes correspond to the value of for three different values of , the middle of which is . Is positive or negative? Why? What does measure?         The figures seem to indicate that the slopes of the tangent lines to the trace increase as increases. Note that , so as increases the slopes of the tangent lines become less negative. Note also that which is a decreasing function. This tells us that the trace is concave down. That means that the slopes of the tangent lines to the trace are increasing, but at a decreasing rate. This is reflected in the fact that the surface seems to be leveling off as increases.    Based on the figure, the slopes of the tangent lines in the direction along the trace appear to be negative, but getting less negative as increases. So we expect to be positive.    Since , we have .

  "body": " Linearization: Tangent Planes and Differentials     What does it mean for a function of two variables to be locally linear at a point?    How do we find the equation of the plane tangent to a locally linear function at a point?    What is the differential of a multivariable function of two variables and what are its uses?      One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the graph of a differentiable function, when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a line. We call this line the tangent line and measure its slope with the derivative. In this section, we will extend this concept to functions of several variables.  Let's see what happens when we look at the graph of a two-variable function on a small scale. To begin, let's consider the function defined by whose graph is shown in Figure .   The graph of .    We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point . In particular, we wish to view the graph on an increasingly small scale around this point, as shown in the two plots in Figure    The graph of .       Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a line when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable function looks like a plane, as seen in Figure . In the following preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this plane.   The graph of .    In what follows, we will also use the important fact As we saw in Section , the equation of a plane passing through the point may be written in the form . If the plane is not vertical, then , and we can rearrange this and hence write and thus where and , respectively. that the plane passing through may be expressed in the form , where and are constants.    Let , and let .   Evaluate and its partial derivatives at ; that is, find , , and .    We know one point on the tangent plane; namely, the -value of the tangent plane agrees with the -value on the graph of at the point . In other words, both the tangent plane and the graph of the function contain the point . Use this observation to determine in the expression .    Sketch the traces of for and below in Figure .  The traces of with and .          Determine the equation of the tangent line of the trace that you sketched in the previous part with (in the direction) at the point .  The traces of and the tangent plane.           Figure shows the traces of the function and the traces of the tangent plane. Explain how the tangent line of the trace of , whose equation you found in the last part of this activity, is related to the tangent plane. How does this observation help you determine the constant in the equation for the tangent plane ? (Hint: How do you think should be related to ?)    In a similar way to what you did in (d), determine the equation of the tangent line of the trace with at the point . Explain how this tangent line is related to the tangent plane, and use this observation to determine the constant in the equation for the tangent plane . (Hint: How do you think should be related to ?)    Finally, write the equation of the tangent plane to the graph of at the point .         Since and we have , , and .    Since we must have .    The slope of the tangent line to the trace of with (in the direction) at is . So the equation of this tangent line is .    The tangent line of the trace on the surface in the direction at the point is the same as the tangent line found in the last part of this activity with constant at . The slope of this line tells us how changes as we change only the coordinate at this point. So that slope, , should be the value of in the equation of the tangent plane. In other words, should be equal to .    The slope of the tangent line to the trace of with (in the direction) at is . So the equation of this tangent line is . The tangent line of the trace on the surface in the direction at the point is the same as the tangent line just found with constant at . The slope of this line tells us how changes as we change only the coordinate at this point. So that slope, , should be the value of in the equation of the tangent plane. In other words, should be equal to .    The equation of the tangent plane to the graph of at the point is .        Since and we have , , and .    Since we must have .    The slope of the tangent line to the trace of with (in the direction) at is . So the equation of this tangent line is .    The tangent line of the trace on the surface in the direction at the point is the same as the tangent line found in the last part of this activity with constant at . The slope of this line tells us how changes as we change only the coordinate at this point. So that slope, , should be the value of in the equation of the tangent plane. In other words, should be equal to .    The slope of the tangent line to the trace of with (in the direction) at is . So the equation of this tangent line is . The tangent line of the trace on the surface in the direction at the point is the same as the tangent line just found with constant at . The slope of this line tells us how changes as we change only the coordinate at this point. So that slope, , should be the value of in the equation of the tangent plane. In other words, should be equal to .    The equation of the tangent plane to the graph of at the point is .        The Tangent Plane  Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for a general function , we need to discuss a technical condition. As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable function on a small scale near a point , we expect to see a line; in this case, we say that is locally linear near since the graph looks like a linear function locally around . Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by , that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.  In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function is locally linear function locally linear near provided that the graph of looks like a plane (its tangent plane ) when viewed on a small scale near . How can we tell when a function of two variables is locally linear at a point?  It is not unreasonable to expect that if and exist for some function at a point , then is locally linear at . This is not sufficient, however. As an example, consider the function defined by . In Exercise you are asked to show that and both exist, but that is not locally linear at (see Figure ). So the existence of the two first order partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee local linearity at that point.  It would take us too far afield to provide a rigorous dicussion of differentiability of functions of more than one variable (see Exercise for a little more detail), so we will be content to define stronger, but more easily verified, conditions that ensure local linearity.   Differentiablity  If is a function of the independent variables and and both and exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point , then is continuously differentiable function continuously differentiable at .   As a consequence, whenever a function is continuously differentiable at a point , it follows that the function has a tangent plane at . Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually indistinguishable. (We won't formally define differentiability of multivariable functions here, and for our purposes continuous differentiability is the only condition we will ever need to use. It is important to note that continuous differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to continuously differentiable functions.) In addition, as in Preview Activity , we find the following general formula for the tangent plane.   The tangent plane  If has continuous first-order partial derivatives, then the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of at the point is     Important Note: As can be seen in Exercise , it is possible that and can exist for a function , and so the plane exists even though is not locally linear at (because the graph of does not look linear when we zoom in around the point ). In such a case this plane is not tangent to the graph. Differentiability for a function of two variables implies the existence of a tangent plane, but the existence of the two first order partial derivatives of a function at a point does not imply differentiaility. This is quite different than what happens in single variable calculus.  Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent plane, . Say, for example, that we have the particular tangent plane . Observe that we can immediately read from this form that and ; furthermore, is the slope of the trace to both and the tangent plane in the -direction at . In the same way, is the slope of the trace of both and the tangent plane in the -direction at .      Find the equation of the tangent plane to at the point . Simplify as much as possible. Does the result surprise you? Explain.    Find the equation of the tangent plane to at the point .        Since and we have and . So the equation of the plane tangent to at is or . Simplifying yields , which is the same as the original function! However, note that the original function is the function of a plane. Since the tangent plane is the plane that is closest to (or best approximates) the original function at the point of tangency, it makes sense that the tangent plane to a plane is exactly the original plane itself.    Since and we have and . So the equation of the plane tangent to at is or .        Since and we have and . So the equation of the plane tangent to at is or . Simplifying yields , which is the same as the original function! However, note that the original function is the function of a plane. Since the tangent plane is the plane that is closest to (or best approximates) the original function at the point of tangency, it makes sense that the tangent plane to a plane is exactly the original plane itself.    Since and we have and . So the equation of the plane tangent to at is or .        Linearization  In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is to approximate the value of a differentiable function. Near the point , the tangent line to the graph of at is close to the graph of near , as shown in Figure .   The linearization of the single-variable function .       In this single-variable setting, we let denote the function whose graph is the tangent line, and thus   Furthermore, observe that near . We call the linearization of .  In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function at a point provides a good approximation of near . Here, we define the linearization, , to be the two-variable function whose graph is the tangent plane, and thus   Finally, note that for points near . This is illustrated in Figure .   The linearization of .      In what follows, we find the linearization of several different functions that are given in algebraic, tabular, or graphical form.   Find the linearization for the function defined by at the point . Then use the linearization to estimate the value of .

Use the data to first estimate the appropriate partial derivatives, and then find the linearization at the point . Finally, use the linearization to estimate , , and . Compare your results to what you obtained in Activity      Figure gives a contour plot of a continuously differentiable function .  A contour plot of .   After estimating appropriate partial derivatives, determine the linearization at the point , and use it to estimate , , and .         To find the linearization of we need the first order partials. Now . So the linearization of at the point (1,2) is . It follows that . Since , we have a fair approximation. This should be expected since the step sizes of 0.2 and 0.3 are not that small.

The last two should be poor approximations since we are approximating quite far from the base point of .        Differentials  As we have seen, the linearization enables us to estimate the value of for points near the base point . Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the change in as we move from the base point to another point .   The differential approximates the change in .     Figure illustrates this situation. Suppose we are at the point , and we know the value of at . If we consider the displacement to a new point , we would like to know how much the function has changed. We denote this change by , where   A simple way to estimate the change is to approximate it by , which represents the change in the linearization as we move from to . This gives   For consistency, we will denote the change in the independent variables as and , and thus   Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have   We call the quantities , , and  differentials differentials , and we think of them as measuring small changes in the quantities , , and . Equations and express the relationship between these changes. Equation resembles an important idea from single-variable calculus: when depends on , it follows in the notation of differentials that   We will illustrate the use of differentials with an example.   Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles of width cm and height cm. However, the machine isn't perfect, and therefore the width could be off by cm and the height could be off by cm.  The area of the rectangle is so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is square centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would like to know how much the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using , and find that   Since and , we have   That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by as much as 10 square centimeters.     The questions in this activity explore the differential in several different contexts.   Suppose that the elevation of a landscape is given by the function , where we additionally know that , , and . Assume that and are measured in miles in the easterly and northerly directions, respectively, from some base point . Your GPS device says that you are currently at the point . However, you know that the coordinates are only accurate to within units; that is, and . Estimate the uncertainty in your elevation using differentials.    The pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas are related by the equation where is measured in kilopascals, in liters, and in kelvin. Find the pressure when the volume is 12 liters and the temperature is 310 K. Use differentials to estimate the change in the pressure when the volume increases to 12.3 liters and the temperature decreases to 305 K.    Refer to Table , the table of values of the wind chill , in degrees Fahrenheit, as a function of temperature, also in degrees Fahrenheit, and wind speed, in miles per hour. Suppose your anemometer says the wind is blowing at miles per hour and your thermometer shows a reading of degrees. However, you know your thermometer is only accurate to within degrees and your anemometer is only accurate to within miles per hour. What is the wind chill based on your measurements? Estimate the uncertainty in your measurement of the wind chill.         The error is approximated by the differential .    First note that . To find the differential, we need both and .

Just as we can find a local linearization for a differentiable function of two variables, we can do so for functions of three or more variables. By extending the concept of the local linearization from two to three variables, find the linearization of the function at the point . Then, use the linearization to estimate the value of .

Let represent the vertical displacement in centimeters from the rest position of a string (like a guitar string) as a function of the distance in centimeters from the fixed left end of the string and the time in seconds after the string has been plucked. (An interesting video of this can be seen at https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TKF6nFzpHBUA .) A simple model for could be Use the differential to approximate how much more this vibrating string is vertically displaced from its position at if we decrease by cm and increase the time by seconds. Compare to the value of at the point .    Resistors used in electrical circuits have colored bands painted on them to indicate the amount of resistance and the possible error in the resistance. When three resistors, whose resistances are , , and , are connected in parallel, the total resistance is given by Suppose that the resistances are , , and . Find the total resistance . If you know each of , , and with a possible error of %, estimate the maximum error in your calculation of .        We have , so the string is vertically displaced approximately centimeters from its position at . Comparing to the exact displacement , we see that our approximation is off by about .     . The maximum error in our calculation is about 0.18%.       First note that and . So with and we have . So the string is vertically displaced approximately centimeters from its position at . Comparing to the exact displacement , we see that our approximation is off by about .    The total resistance satisfies , so . We can write as . Then . This gives us . If , then . So the maximum error in our calculation is about 0.18%.      In this section we argued that if is a function of two variables and if and both exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point , then is differentiable at . This condition ensures that is differentiable at , but it does not define what it means for to be differentiable at . In this exercise we explore the definition of differentiability of a function of two variables in more detail. Throughout, let be the function defined by .   Use appropriate technology to plot the graph of on the domain . Explain why is not locally linear at .    Show that both and exist. If is locally linear at , what must be the equation of the tangent plane to at ?    Recall that if a function of a single variable is differentiable at , then exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of means that the graph of is locally linear at . In other words, the graph of looks like its linearization for close to . That is, the values of can be closely approximated by as long as is close to . We can measure how good the approximation of is to with the error function As approaches , approaches , and so provides increasingly better approximations to as gets closer to . Show that, even though is not locally linear at , its error term at has a limit of as approaches . (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to as approaches , we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at .    As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider as a function of one variable. If we let , where is the distance from to , then the relative error in approximating with is Show that, for a function of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is as approaches .    Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function at a point , then if and , the distance from to is .      A function is differentiable at a point differentiable function if there is a linear function such that the relative error has at limit of at , where , , and .    A function is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function in the definition is the linearization of at . Verify that is not differentiable at by showing that the relative error at does not have a limit at . Conclude that the existence of partial derivatives at a point is not enough to ensure differentiability at that point. (Hint: Consider the limit along different paths.)        (INSERT PIC HERE) From the graph, it appears that the surface comes to a sharp point at and thus is not locally linear - no matter how much we zoom in, the surface will have a sharp corner and will not look like a plane.    We have . Similarly, . Furthermore, , so if is locally linear at we must have .    We have since goes to 0 as goes to .    We have .    We want to verify that the limit of does not exist at . Note that , so . Taking the limit along the path yields . However, taking the limit along the path yields . Since the limits along different paths are not equal, the limit does not exist. Note that more generally, we could consider the limit along the linear path for some constant . Then we have . This limit has different values for different values of , so again we see that the limit does not exist.

This condition ensures that is differentiable at , but it does not define what it means for to be differentiable at .

Use appropriate technology to plot the graph of on the domain . Explain why is not locally linear at .    Show that both and exist. If is locally linear at , what must be the equation of the tangent plane to at ?    Recall that if a function of a single variable is differentiable at , then exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of means that the graph of is locally linear at . In other words, the graph of looks like its linearization for close to . That is, the values of can be closely approximated by as long as is close to . We can measure how good the approximation of is to with the error function As approaches , approaches , and so provides increasingly better approximations to as gets closer to . Show that, even though is not locally linear at , its error term at has a limit of as approaches . (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to as approaches , we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at .    As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider as a function of one variable. If we let , where is the distance from to , then the relative error in approximating with is Show that, for a function of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is as approaches .    Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function at a point , then if and , the distance from to is .      A function is differentiable at a point differentiable function if there is a linear function such that the relative error has at limit of at , where , , and .    A function is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function in the definition is the linearization of at . Verify that is not differentiable at by showing that the relative error at does not have a limit at . Conclude that the existence of partial derivatives at a point is not enough to ensure differentiability at that point. (Hint: Consider the limit along different paths.)

  "body": " The Chain Rule     What is the Chain Rule and how do we use it to find a derivative?    How can we use a tree diagram to guide us in applying the Chain Rule?      In single-variable calculus, we encountered situations in which some quantity depends on and, in turn, depends on . A change in produces a change in , which consequently produces a change in . Using the language of differentials that we saw in the previous section, these changes are naturally related by   In terms of instantaneous rates of change, we then have and thus   This most recent equation we call the Chain Rule .  In the case of a function of two variables where , it might be that both and depend on another variable . A change in then produces changes in both and , which then cause to change. In this section we will see how to find the change in that is caused by a change in , leading us to multivariable versions of the Chain Rule involving both regular and partial derivatives.    Suppose you are driving around in the -plane in such a way that your position at time is given by function   The path taken is shown on the left of Figure .   Left: Your position in the plane. Right: The corresponding temperature.       Suppose, furthermore, that the temperature at a point in the plane is given by and note that the surface generated by is shown on the right of Figure . Therefore, as time passes, your position changes, and, as your position changes, the temperature also changes.   The position function provides a parameterization and of the position at time . By substituting for and for in the formula for , we can write as a function of . Make these substitutions to write as a function of and then use the Chain Rule from single variable calculus to find . (Do not do any algebra to simplify the derivative, either before taking the derivative, nor after.)    Now we want to understand how the result from part (a) can be obtained from as a multivariable function. Recall from the previous section that small changes in and produce a change in that is approximated by The Chain Rule tells us about the instantaneous rate of change of , and this can be found as Use equation to explain why the instantaneous rate of change of that results from a change in is     Using the original formulas for , , and in the problem statement, calculate all of the derivatives in Equation (with and in terms of and , and and in terms of ), and hence write the right-hand side of Equation in terms of , , and .    Compare the results of parts (a) and (c). Write a couple of sentences that identify specifically how each term in (c) relates to a corresponding terms in (a). This connection between parts (a) and (c) provides a multivariable version of the Chain Rule.          and     Since and and don't depend on , we have .     so .    With and , the results of parts (a) and (c) are the same. The terms and in (c) agree with what we get when we differentiate the outermost functions in (a). We can see where the terms and in part (c) come from using the Chain Rule in (a) when we differentiate the innermost functions.        With and we have . So .    Since and and don't depend on , we have .    We find that . Then .    With and , the results of parts (a) and (c) are the same. The terms and in (c) agree with what we get when we differentiate the outermost functions in (a). We can see where the terms and in part (c) come from using the Chain Rule in (a) when we differentiate the innermost functions.        The Chain Rule  As Preview Activity suggests, the following version of the Chain Rule holds in general.   The Chain Rule  Let , where is a differentiable function of the independent variables and , and let and each be differentiable functions of an independent variable . Then    It is important to note the differences among the derivatives in . Since is a function of the two variables and , the derivatives in the Chain Rule for with respect to and are partial derivatives. However, since and are functions of the single variable , their derivatives are the standard derivatives of functions of one variable. When we compose with and , we then have as a function of the single variable , making the derivative of with respect to a standard derivative from single variable calculus as well.  To understand why this Chain Rule works in general, suppose that some quantity depends on and so that   Next, suppose that and each depend on another quantity , so that   Combining Equations and , we find that which is the Chain Rule in this particular context, as expressed in Equation .    In the following questions, we apply the Chain Rule in several different contexts.    Suppose that we have a function defined by . In addition, suppose that and are restricted to points that move around the plane by following a circle of radius centered at the origin that is parameterized by     Use the Chain Rule to find the resulting instantaneous rate of change .    Substitute for and for in the rule for to write in terms of and calculate directly. Compare to the result of part (i.).      Suppose that the temperature on a metal plate is given by the function with where the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and and are each measured in feet.    Find and . What are the units on these partial derivatives?    Suppose an ant is walking along the -axis at the rate of 2 feet per minute toward the origin. When the ant is at the point , what is the instantaneous rate of change in the temperature that the ant experiences. Include units on your response.    Suppose instead that the ant walks along an ellipse with and , where is measured in minutes. Find at , , and . What does this seem to tell you about the path along which the ant is walking?      Suppose that you are walking along a surface whose elevation is given by a function . Furthermore, suppose that if you consider how your location corresponds to points in the -plane, you know that when you pass the point , your velocity vector is . If some contours of are as shown in Figure , estimate the rate of change when you pass through .  Some contours of .             According to the Chain Rule we have .     This is the same as the derivative above.         , both measured in units of degrees Fahrenheit per foot.         In this case we have . So . The fact that means that is not changing, so on the path the ant is walking the temperature is constant. Note that , so the ant is walking along a path of constant temperature .       .          According to the Chain Rule we have .    Substituting for and for in the rule for yields , so . This is the same as the derivative we found above.        We have , both measured in units of degrees Fahrenheit per foot.    In this situation we have and . So . Therefore, .    In this case we have . So . The fact that means that is not changing, so on the path the ant is walking the temperature is constant. Note that , so the ant is walking along a path of constant temperature .      Since , we need to estimate and at . Now . The velocity vector at the point tells us and at the point , so .        Tree Diagrams  Up to this point, we have applied the Chain Rule to situations where we have a function of variables and , with both and depending on another single quantity . We may apply the Chain Rule, however, when and each depend on more than one quantity, or when is a function of more than two variables. It can be challenging to keep track of all the dependencies among the variables, and thus a tree diagram can be a useful tool to organize our work. For example, suppose that depends on and , and and both depend on . We may represent these relationships using the tree diagram shown at left Figure . We place the dependent variable at the top of the tree and connect it to the variables on which it depends one level below. We then connect each of those variables to the variable on which each depends.   A tree diagram illustrating dependencies.       To represent the Chain Rule, we label every edge of the diagram with the appropriate derivative or partial derivative, as seen at right in Figure . To calculate an overall derivative according to the Chain Rule, we construct the product of the derivatives along all paths connecting the variables and then add all of these products. For example, the diagram at right in Figure illustrates the Chain Rule        Figure shows the tree diagram we construct when (a) depends on , , and , (b) , , and each depend on and , and (c) and depend on .

In its simplest form, it says that if is a function of two variables and and depend on , then     A tree diagram can be used to represent the dependence of variables on other variables. By following the links in the tree diagram, we can form chains of partial derivatives or derivatives that can be combined to give a desired partial derivative.        Use the chain rule to find , where  First the pieces:          End result (in terms of just ):                                    Use the chain rule to find and , where  First the pieces:        And putting it all together:  and                                       Suppose , where  , and .

  "body": " Directional Derivatives and the Gradient     The partial derivatives of a function tell us the rate of change of in the direction of the coordinate axes. How can we measure the rate of change of in other directions?    What is the gradient of a function and what does it tell us?      The partial derivatives of a function tell us the instantaneous rate at which the function changes as we hold all but one independent variable constant and allow the remaining independent variable to change. It is natural to wonder how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in directions other than parallel to a coordinate axes. In what follows, we investigate this question, and see how the rate of change in any given direction is connected to the rates of change given by the standard partial derivatives.    Let's consider the function defined by and suppose that measures the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at a given point in the plane, where and are measured in feet. Assume that the positive -axis points due east, while the positive -axis points due north. A contour plot of is shown in Figure    A contour plot of .      Suppose that a person is walking due east, and thus parallel to the -axis. At what instantaneous rate is the temperature changing with respect to at the moment the walker passes the point ? What are the units on this rate of change?    Next, determine the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to distance at the point if the person is instead walking due north. Again, include units on your result.    Now, rather than walking due east or due north, let's suppose that the person is walking with velocity given by the vector , where time is measured in seconds. Note that the person's speed is thus feet per second. Find parametric equations for the person's path; that is, parameterize the line through using the direction vector . Let denote the -coordinate of the line, and its -coordinate. Make sure your parameterization places the walker at the point when .    With the parameterization in (c), we can now view the temperature as not only a function of and , but also of time, . Hence, use the chain rule to determine the value of . What are the units on your answer? What is the practical meaning of this result?                       With the parameterization in (c), we have . So . So the temperature is decreasing by 108 degrees Celsius for every second she moves in the direction of from the point .        The instantaneous rate of change in the temperature when a person is walking due east at the moment she passes the point is given by . Since , we have .    The instantaneous rate of change in the temperature when a person is walking due north at the moment she passes the point is given by . Since , we have .    Parametric equations for the line through in the direction of are .    With the parameterization in (c), we have . So . So the temperature is decreasing by 108 degrees Celsius for every second she moves in the direction of from the point .        Directional Derivatives  Given a function , the partial derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of as only the variable changes; likewise, measures the rate of change of at as only changes. Note particularly that is measured in units of per unit of change in , and that the units on are similar.  In Preview Activity , we saw how we could measure the rate of change of in a situation where both and were changing; in that activity, however, we found that this rate of change was measured in units of per unit of time . In a given unit of time, we may move more than one unit of distance. In fact, in Preview Activity , in each unit increase in time we move a distance of feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of our choice, we instead want to have a rate of change whose units are units of per unit of distance in the given direction.   In this light, in order to formally define the derivative in a particular direction of motion, we want to represent the change in for a given unit change in the direction of motion. We can represent this unit change in direction with a unit vector, say . If we move a distance in the direction of from a fixed point , we then arrive at the new point . It now follows that the slope of the secant line to the curve on the surface through in the direction of through the points and is   To get the instantaneous rate of change of in the direction , we must take the limit of the quantity in Equation as . Doing so results in the formal definition of the directional derivative.    Let be given. The derivative of at the point in the direction of the unit vector directional derivative is denoted and is given by for those values of and for which the limit exists.    The quantity is called a directional derivative . When we evaluate the directional derivative at a point , the result tells us the instantaneous rate at which changes at per unit increase in the direction of the vector . In addition, the quantity tells us the slope of the line tangent to the surface in the direction of at the point .    Computing the Directional Derivative  In a similar way to how we developed shortcut rules for standard derivatives in single variable calculus, and for partial derivatives in multivariable calculus, we can also find a way to evaluate directional derivatives without resorting to the limit definition found in Equation . We do so using a very similar approach to our work in Preview Activity .  Suppose we consider the situation where we are interested in the instantaneous rate of change of at a point in the direction , where is a unit vector. The variables and are therefore changing according to the parameterization   Observe that and for all values of . Since is a unit vector, it follows that a point moving along this line moves one unit of distance per one unit of time; that is, each single unit of time corresponds to movement of a single unit of distance in that direction. This observation allows us to use the Chain Rule to calculate the directional derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to change in the direction .  In particular, by the Chain Rule, it follows that   This now allows us to compute the directional derivative at an arbitrary point according to the following formula.   Calculating a directional derivative  Given a differentiable function and a unit vector , we may compute by     Note well: To use Equation , we must have a unit vector in the direction of motion. In the event that we have a direction prescribed by a non-unit vector, we must first scale the vector to have length 1.    Let .   Determine and .    Use Equation to determine and . What familiar function is ? What familiar function is ? (Recall that is the unit vector in the positive -direction and is the unit vector in the positive -direction.)    Use Equation to find the derivative of in the direction of the vector at the point . Remember that a unit direction vector is needed.               ,              We have .    Since , we have . So the derivative of in the direction of the vector is just the partial derivative of with respect to . Similarly, . So the derivative of in the direction of the vector is just the partial derivative of with respect to .    At the point we have . So the derivative of in the direction of the unit vector at the point is .        The Gradient  Via the Chain Rule, we have seen that for a given function , its instantaneous rate of change in the direction of a unit vector is given by   Recalling that the dot product of two vectors and is computed by we see that we may recast Equation in a way that has geometric meaning. In particular, we see that is the dot product of the vector and the vector .  We call this vector formed by the partial derivatives of the gradient of and denote it   We read as the gradient of ,  grad or del . The symbol is called nabla , which comes from a Greek word for a certain type of harp that has a similar shape. Notice that varies from point to point, and also provides an alternate formulation of the directional derivative.  The directional derivative and the gradient  Given a differentiable function and a unit vector , we may compute by   In the following activity, we investigate some of what the gradient tells us about the behavior of a function .    Let's consider the function defined by . Some contours for this function are shown in Figure .   Contours of .      Find the gradient .    For each of the following points , evaluate the gradient and sketch the gradient vector with its tail at . Some of the vectors are too long to fit onto the plot, but we'd like to draw them to scale; to do so, scale each vector by a factor of 1\/4.                                         What do you notice about the relationship between the gradient at and the contour passing through that point?    Does increase or decrease in the direction of ? Provide a justification for your response.             We apply the formula for the gradient to see that . A picture of the scaled gradients are shown here.     It appears that each gradient is orthogonal to the contour containing its tail.    In the first quadrant, as increases so does . So these gradients all point in a direction of increase of . In the second quadrant, as decreases increases. So these gradients all point in a direction of increase of . In the third quadrant, as increases so does . So these gradients all point in a direction of increase of . Finally, at the point , increases as decreases. So every gradient points in a direction of increase of .        By definition, .    We apply the formula for the gradient to see that . A picture of the scaled gradients are shown here.     It appears that each gradient is orthogonal to the contour containing its tail.    In the first quadrant, as increases so does . So these gradients all point in a direction of increase of . In the second quadrant, as decreases increases. So these gradients all point in a direction of increase of . In the third quadrant, as increases so does . So these gradients all point in a direction of increase of . Finally, at the point , increases as decreases. So every gradient points in a direction of increase of .      As a vector, defines a direction and a length. As we will soon see, both of these convey important information about the behavior of near .    The Direction of the Gradient  Remember that the dot product also conveys information about the angle between the two vectors. If is the angle between and (where is a unit vector), then we also have that   In particular, when is a right angle, as shown on the left of Figure , then , because . Since the value of the directional derivative is 0, this means that is unchanging in this direction, and hence must be tangent to the contour of that passes through . In other words, is orthogonal to the contour through . This shows that the gradient vector at a given point is always perpendicular to the contour passing through the point, confirming that what we saw in part (c) of Activity holds in general.   The sign of is determined by .        Moreover, when is an acute angle, it follows that so since and therefore , as shown in the middle image in Figure . This means that is increasing in any direction where is acute. In a similar way, when is an obtuse angle, then so , as seen on the right in Figure . This means that is decreasing in any direction for which is obtuse.  Finally, as we can see in the following activity, we may also use the gradient to determine the directions in which the function is increasing and decreasing most rapidly.    In this activity we investigate how the gradient is related to the directions of greatest increase and decrease of a function. Let be a differentiable function and a unit vector.   Let be the angle between and . Use the relationship between the dot product and the angle between two vectors to explain why     At the point , the only quantity in Equation that can change is (which determines the direction of travel). Explain why makes the quantity as large as possible.    When , in what direction does the unit vector point relative to ? Why? What does this tell us about the direction of greatest increase of at the point ?    In what direction, relative to , does decrease most rapidly at the point ?    State the unit vectors and (in terms of ) that provide the directions of greatest increase and decrease for the function at the point . What important assumption must we make regarding in order for these vectors to exist?         Using the dot product we can see that , where is the angle between and .    The maximum value of will occur when is as large as possible. This happens when or .    When , the angle between the vector and the vector is 0, so the vector must have the same direction as . In other words, the direction of greatest increase of at the point is the direction of the vector .         The unit vector that provides the direction of greatest increase in at the point is and the unit vector that provides the direction of greatest decrease in at the point is . For either vector to exist, it must be the case that .        Using the dot product we can see that , where is the angle between and .    The maximum value of will occur when is as large as possible. This happens when or .    When , the angle between the vector and the vector is 0, so the vector must have the same direction as . In other words, the direction of greatest increase of at the point is the direction of the vector .    If increases most rapidly in the direction of at the point , then must decrease most rapidly in the opposite direction, or in the direction of .    The unit vector that provides the direction of greatest increase in at the point is and the unit vector that provides the direction of greatest decrease in at the point is . For either vector to exist, it must be the case that .        The Length of the Gradient  Having established in Activity that the direction in which a function increases most rapidly at a point is the unit vector in the direction of the gradient, (that is, , provided that ), it is also natural to ask, in the direction of greatest increase for at , what is the value of the rate of increase? In this situation, we are asking for the value of where .  Using the now familiar way to compute the directional derivative, we see that   Next, we recall two important facts about the dot product: (i) for any scalar , and (ii) . Applying these properties to the most recent equation involving the directional derivative, we find that   Finally, since is a nonzero vector, its length is a nonzero scalar, and thus we can simplify the preceding equation to establish that   We summarize our most recent work by stating two important facts about the gradient.   Important facts about the gradient  Let be a differentiable function and a point for which . Then points in the direction of greatest increase of at , and the instantaneous rate of change of in that direction is the length of the gradient vector. That is, if , then is a unit vector in the direction of greatest increase of at , and .     Consider the function defined by .   Find the gradient and sketch it on Figure .  A plot for the gradient .       Sketch the unit vector on Figure with its tail at . Now find the directional derivative .    What is the slope of the graph of in the direction ? What does the sign of the directional derivative tell you?    Consider the vector and sketch on Figure with its tail at . Find a unit vector pointing in the same direction of . Without computing , what do you know about the sign of this directional derivative? Now verify your observation by computing .    In which direction (that is, for what unit vector ) is the greatest? What is the slope of the graph in this direction?    Corresponding, in which direction is least? What is the slope of the graph in this direction?    Sketch two unit vectors for which and then find component representations of these vectors.    Suppose you are standing at the point . In which direction should you move to cause to increase as rapidly as possible? At what rate does increase in this direction?          A plot of is shown below.    A plot of is shown below.     The directional derivative tells us the slope of in the direction of at the point , so this slope is . The fact that is negative tells us that the graph of is decreasing in the direction of from the point .    The angle between the vector or the vector (shown below) and is acute, so we expect to be increasing in this direction.      We know that increases most rapidly in the direction of the gradient. So is greatest when . The slope of the graph of in the direction of at the point is .    The function decreases most rapidly in the direction opposite of the gradient. So is least when . The slope of the graph of in the direction of at the point is .    Recall that , so when is perpendicular to . By inspection, two such vectors are and .    The direction in which increases most rapidly at the point is in the direction of the gradient vector at , so in the direction of or the unit vector . The rate of increase of in this direction is .        The gradient of at is , so the gradient of at is . A plot of is shown below.    A plot of is shown below. The directional derivative is .

The fact that is negative tells us that the graph of is decreasing in the direction of from the point .    The angle between the vector or the vector (shown below) and is acute, so we expect to be increasing in this direction. Note that .     We know that increases most rapidly in the direction of the gradient. So is greatest when . The slope of the graph of in the direction of at the point is .    The function decreases most rapidly in the direction opposite of the gradient. So is least when . The slope of the graph of in the direction of at the point is .    Recall that , so when is perpendicular to . By inspection, two such vectors are and .    The direction in which increases most rapidly at the point is in the direction of the gradient vector at , so in the direction of or the unit vector . The rate of increase of in this direction is .        Applications  The gradient finds many natural applications. For example, situations often arise for instance, constructing a road through the mountains or planning the flow of water across a landscape where we are interested in knowing the direction in which a function is increasing or decreasing most rapidly.  For example, consider a two-dimensional version of how a heat-seeking missile might work.(This application is borrowed from United States Air Force Academy Department of Mathematical Sciences.) Suppose that the temperature surrounding a fighter jet can be modeled by the function defined by where is a point in the plane of the fighter jet and is measured in degrees Celsius. Some contours and gradients are shown on the left in Figure .   Contours and gradient for and the missile's path.       A heat-seeking missile will always travel in the direction in which the temperature increases most rapidly; that is, it will always travel in the direction of the gradient . If a missile is fired from the point , then its path will be that shown on the right in Figure .  In the final activity of this section, we consider several questions related to this context of a heat-seeking missile, and foreshadow some upcoming work in Section .      The temperature has its maximum value at the fighter jet's location. State the fighter jet's location and explain how Figure tells you this.    Determine at the fighter jet's location and give a justification for your response.    Suppose that a different function has a local maximum value at . Sketch the behavior of some possible contours near this point. What is ? (Hint: What is the direction of greatest increase in at the local maximum?)    Suppose that a function has a local minimum value at . Sketch the behavior of some possible contours near this point. What is ?    If a function has a local minimum at , what is the direction of greatest increase of at ?        The gradient points toward the direction of greatest in , and the gradient vectors are all directed toward the point . So the fighter jet's location is .    At the fighter jet's location, the temperature doesn't increase, so we should expect to be the zero vector there. Note that and , and so .    Contours of might look like the contours of near the point . At the relative maximum point we would have , provided exists.    Contours of might look like the contours of near the point only with the gradients pointing outward instead of inward. At the relative maximum point we would have , provided exists.    If has a local minimum at and , then any direction will provide the greatest increase in at the point .        The gradient points toward the direction of greatest in , and the gradient vectors are all directed toward the point . So the fighter jet's location is .    At the fighter jet's location, the temperature doesn't increase, so we should expect to be the zero vector there. Note that and , and so .    Contours of might look like the contours of near the point . At the relative maximum point we would have , provided exists.    Contours of might look like the contours of near the point only with the gradients pointing outward instead of inward. At the relative maximum point we would have , provided exists.    If has a local minimum at and , then any direction will provide the greatest increase in at the point .        Summary    The directional derivative of at the point in the direction of the unit vector is for those values of and for which the limit exists. In addition, measures the slope of the graph of when we move in the direction . Alternatively, measures the instantaneous rate of change of in the direction at .    The gradient of a function at a point is the vector     The directional derivative in the direction may be computed by     At any point where the gradient is nonzero, gradient is orthogonal to the contour through that point and points in the direction in which increases most rapidly; moreover, the slope of in this direction equals the length of the gradient . Similarly, the opposite of the gradient points in the direction of greatest decrease, and that rate of decrease is the opposite of the length of the gradient.        Consider the function .  Find the gradient of :  , ,  Find the gradient of at the point (2, 1, 2).  , ,  Find the rate of change of the function at the point (2, 1,2) in the direction .

The level curves have equation or . If , these equations represent circles in the - plane.  (b) The largest value of the temperature is attained at .  The value of the temperature at this point is  (c) The greatest increase in temperature at is in the direction of the gradient at the point.  We have  The maximum value of the directional derivative at is given by the magnitude of the gradient at :  (c) The greatest decrease in temperature at is in the opposite direction of the gradient at the point:  The minimum value of the directional derivative at is given by         The temperature at a point (x,y,z) is given by , where is measured in degrees Celsius and x,y, and z in meters. There are lots of places to make silly errors in this problem; just try to keep track of what needs to be a unit vector.

Now we want rate of change with respect to time. If we move at 4 cm\/sec:          At a certain point on a heated metal plate, the greatest rate of temperature increase, 4 degrees Celsius per meter, is toward the northeast. If an object at this point moves directly north, at what rate is the temperature increasing?  degrees Celsius per meter        SOLUTION  Let be the temperature function and the point. The value of the greatest rate of increase is the magnitude of the gradient. Thus .  The gradient points in the northeast direction, so .  A unit vector in the north direction is , so the rate of change of increase of the temperature in that direction is         Suppose that you are climbing a hill whose shape is given by , and that you are at the point (20, 30, 300).  In which direction (unit vector) should you proceed initially in order to reach the top of the hill fastest?  ,  If you climb in that direction, at what angle above the horizontal will you be climbing initially (radian measure)?                        Are the following statements true or false?    If has and at the point , then is constant everywhere.    Suppose and both exist. Then there is always a direction in which the rate of change of at is zero.    If is a unit vector, then is a vector.    is parallel to .    is a vector in 3-dimensional space.

The direction of greatest increase of at the point is .    The direction of greatest decrease of at is . The instantaneous rate of change of in the direction of greatest decrease at the point is .    We want a direction vector so that . So the vector is a direction in which does not change at the point .      Find all directions in which the directional derivative of is 1 at the point .   Any positive scalar multiple of or will give a direction in which the directional derivative is 1.   We have and , so and . For a unit vector , . We want , so we want a unit direction vector with .

The gradient shows the direction of greatest increase of at a point. The gradient is perpendicular to the level curves, and a picture of the unit vector in the direction of the gradient at is shown in the figure below, with the gradient vector scaled appropriately to make it easier to plot.     We need to find a direction so that . Since , we need and to satisfy . So and a direction for which the slope of the tangent line to the surface generated by at the point is zero in the direction is .      The properties of the gradient that we have observed for functions of two variables also hold for functions of more variables. In this problem, we consider a situation where there are three independent variables. Suppose that the temperature in a region of space is described by and that you are standing at the point .   Find the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature in the direction of at the point . Remember that you should first find a unit vector in the direction of .    In what direction from the point would you move to cause the temperature to decrease as quickly as possible?    How fast does the temperature decrease in this direction?    Find a direction in which the temperature does not change at .                   The rate of change of the temperature in this direction is So the temperature decreases at approximately 1.21 units of temperature per one unit of distance in this direction.    possible answers: or in the direction of as shown in part (a)       A unit vector in the direction of is . Since , the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature in the direction of is then .    To cause the temperature to decrease as quickly as possible we move in the direction of .    The rate of change of the temperature in this direction is . So the temperature decreases at approximately 1.21 in this direction.    Let be a vector in a direction in which the temperature does not change. Then . So a direction in which the temperature does not change is the direction of the vector (or in the direction of as shown in part (a)).       Figure shows a plot of the gradient at several points for some function .   The gradient .      Consider each of the three indicated points, and draw, as best as you can, the contour through that point.    Beginning at each point, draw a curve on which is continually decreasing.       Since the gradient at a point is orthogonal to the contour at that point, the contours through the indicated points are drawn orthogonal to the gradients. This is illustrated in the figures below.       The gradient points in the direction of the greatest increase of the function, so a curve that moves in the direction opposite the gradient is a curve on which is decreasing. This is illustrated in the figures below.          Since the gradient at a point is orthogonal to the contour at that point, the contours through the indicated points are drawn orthogonal to the gradients. This is illustrated in the figures below.

How can we find the absolute maximum and minimum of on a closed and bounded domain?      We learn in single-variable calculus that the derivative is a useful tool for finding the local maxima and minima of functions, and that these ideas may often be employed in applied settings. In particular, if a function , such as the one shown in Figure is everywhere differentiable, we know that the tangent line is horizontal at any point where has a local maximum or minimum. This, of course, means that the derivative is zero at any such point. Hence, one way that we seek extreme values of a given function is to first find where the derivative of the function is zero.   The graph of .    In multivariable calculus, we are often similarly interested in finding the greatest and\/or least value(s) that a function may achieve. Moreover, there are many applied settings in which a quantity of interest depends on several different variables. In the following preview activity, we begin to see how some key ideas in multivariable calculus can help us answer such questions by thinking about the geometry of the surface generated by a function of two variables.    Let be a differentiable function, and suppose that at the point , achieves a local maximum. That is, the value of is greater than the value of for all nearby . You might find it helpful to sketch a rough picture of a possible function that has this property.   If we consider the trace given by holding constant, then the single-variable function defined by must have a local maximum at . What does this say about the value of the partial derivative ?    In the same way, the trace given by holding constant has a local maximum at . What does this say about the value of the partial derivative ?    What may we now conclude about the gradient at the local maximum? How is this consistent with the statement increases most rapidly in the direction ?     How will the tangent plane to the surface appear at the point ?    By first computing the partial derivatives, find any points at which may have a local maximum.                        The tangent plane to the surface at the point will have the form . So the tangent plane will be parallel to the - plane.    The point is the only point at which the function may have a local maximum.        Since is a differentiable function, its derivative in the -direction must be 0 at a local maximum. In other words, .    Since is a differentiable function, its derivative in the -direction must be 0 at a local maximum. In other words, .    Since , we must have . Since the function has a local maximum at the point , the rate of change of in any direction at is 0.    With both and , the tangent plane to the surface at the point will have the form . So the tangent plane will be parallel to the - plane.    We have , so at the point . This is the only point at which the function may have a local maximum.        Extrema and Critical Points  One of the important applications of single-variable calculus is the use of derivatives to identify local extremes of functions (that is, local maxima and local minima). Using the tools we have developed so far, we can naturally extend the concept of local maxima and minima to several-variable functions.    Let be a function of two variables and .   The function has a local maximum at a point provided that for all points near . In this situation we say that is a local maximum value .    The function has a local minimum at a point provided that for all points near . In this situation we say that is a local minimum value .    An absolute maximum point is a point for which for all points in the domain of . The value of at an absolute maximum point is the maximum value of .    An absolute minimum point is a point such that for all points in the domain of . The value of at an absolute minimum point is the minimum value of .       We use the term extremum point to refer to any point at which has a local maximum or minimum. In addition, the function value at an extremum is called an extremal value . Figure illustrates the graphs of two functions that have an absolute maximum and minimum, respectively, at the origin .   An absolute maximum and an absolute minimum       In single-variable calculus, we saw that the extrema of a continuous function always occur at critical points , values of where fails to be differentiable or where . Said differently, critical points provide the locations where extrema of a function may appear. Our work in Preview Activity suggests that something similar happens with two-variable functions.  Suppose that a continuous function has an extremum at . In this case, the trace has an extremum at , which means that is a critical value of . Therefore, either does not exist or . Similarly, either does not exist or . This implies that the extrema of a two-variable function occur at points that satisfy the following definition.    A critical point critical point  of a function is a point in the domain of at which and , or such that one of or fails to exist.    We can therefore find critical points of a function by computing partial derivatives and identifying any values of for which one of the partials doesn't exist or for which both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. For the latter, note that we have to solve the system of equations     Find the critical points of each of the following functions. Then, using appropriate technology, plot the graphs of the surfaces near each critical point and compare the graph to your work.                        .         The point is the only critical point of . The graph of is a paraboloid that opens in the positive -direction, so we should expect only one critical point (at which has an absolute minimum value).    The point is the only critical point of . The graph of is a hyberbolic paraboloid that makes a saddle shape around the origin, so we should expect only one critical point (at which has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum value).    Here, is the only critical point of . The graph of is a paraboloid that opens in the negative -direction, so we should expect only one critical point (at which has an absolute maximum value).    This function has infinitely many critical points those points of the form or . The graph of has sharp folds along the -axis or -axis, so we should expect that is not differentiable at those points. The graph of also indicates that has an absolute minimum value at the point .    The point is the only critical point of . The graph of is a hyperbolic paraboloid, so we can expect that it has only one critical point (at which has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum value).

The graph of is a paraboloid that opens in the positive -direction, so we should expect only one critical point (at which has an absolute minimum value).

The graph of is a paraboloid that opens in the negative -direction, so we should expect only one critical point (at which has an absolute maximum value).    Recall that if , then and does not exist. In this case we will never have , but will fail to exist when or . This gives us infinitely many critical points all points of the form or . The graph of has sharp folds along the -axis or -axis, so we should expect that is not differentiable at those points. The graph of also indicates that has an absolute minimum value at the point .    For this function, . So when and , or at the point . Thus, is the only critical point of . The graph of is a hyperbolic paraboloid, so we can expect that it has only one critical point (at which has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum value).        Classifying Critical Points: The Second Derivative Test  While the extrema of a continuous function always occur at critical points, it is important to note that not every critical point leads to an extremum. Recall, for instance, from single variable calculus. We know that is a critical point since , but is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of .  A similar situation may arise in a multivariable setting. Consider the function defined by whose graph and contour plot are shown in Figure . Because , we see that the origin is a critical point. However, this critical point is neither a local maximum or minimum; the origin is a local minimum on the trace defined by , while the origin is a local maximum on the trace defined by . We call such a critical point a saddle point due to the shape of the graph near the critical point.   A saddle point.       As in single-variable calculus, we would like to have some sort of test to help us identify whether a critical point is a local maximum, local maximum, or neither.    Recall that the Second Derivative Test for single-variable functions states that if is a critical point of a function so that and if exists, then   if , is a local maximum,    if , is a local minimum, and    if , this test yields no information.     Our goal in this activity is to understand a similar test for classifying extreme values of functions of two variables. Consider the following three functions: You can verify that each function has a critical point at the origin . You should check this.  Three surfaces.          The graphs of these three functions are shown in Figure , with at left, in the middle, and at right. Use the graphs to decide if a function has a local maximum, local minimum, saddle point, or none of the above at the origin.    There is no single second derivative of a function of two variables, so we consider a quantity that combines the second order partial derivatives. Let . Calculate at the origin for each of the functions , , and . What difference do you notice between the values of when a function has a maximum or minimum value at the origin versus when a function has a saddle point at the origin?    Now consider the cases where . It is in these cases that a function has a local maximum or minimum at a point. What is necessary in these cases is to find a condition that will distinguish between a maximum and a minimum. In the cases where at the origin, evaluate . What value does have when has a local maximum value at the origin? When has a local minimum value at the origin? Explain why. (Hint: This should look very similar to the Second Derivative Test for functions of a single variable.) What would happen if we considered the values of instead?        From the graphs, we can conclude that has a local maximum at the origin, has a local minimum at the origin, and has neither a maximum nor a minimum at the origin.   For , we have , giving .  For , we have , giving .  For , we find that , giving .  Combining the above information with our conclusions from the previous part, we see that at a point where the function has a maximum or minimum value but at a point where the function has a saddle point.    For our first function, , and , and has a local maximum at . For our second function, , and , and has a local minimum at .  To understand the connection, recall that is the slope of the trace of in the plane . In turn, gives us information about the concavity of that trace. If , we might expect that appears to be concave down in the -direction, which, like the single variable case, may indicate a local maximum at . On the other hand, if , we might expect that appears to be concave up in the -direction, which like the single variable case, may indicate a local minimum at . Since we have a function of two variables, we need to consider the other direction as well. Note that in both of our examples above, the sign of is the same as the sign of . In fact, we need these two partials to have the same sign to get .       From the graphs, we can conclude that has a local maximum at the origin, has a local minimum at the origin, and has neither a maximum nor a minimum at the origin.   For , we have , giving .  For , we have , giving .  For , we find that , giving .  Combining the above information with our conclusions from the previous part, we see that at a point where the function has a maximum or minimum value but at a point where the function has a saddle point.    For our first function, , and , and has a local maximum at . For our second function, , and , and has a local minimum at .  To understand the connection, recall that is the slope of the trace of in the plane . In turn, gives us information about the concavity of that trace.

Since we have a function of two variables, we need to consider the other direction as well. Note that in both of our examples above, the sign of is the same as the sign of . In fact, we need these two partials to have the same sign to get .       Activity provides the basic ideas for the Second Derivative Test for functions of two variables.   The Second Derivative Test  Suppose is a critical point of the function for which and . Let be the quantity defined by    If and , then has a local maximum at .    If and , then has a local minimum at .    If , then has a saddle point at .    If , then this test yields no information about what happens at .     The quantity is called the discriminant discriminant of the function at .   To properly understand the origin of the Second Derivative Test, we could introduce a second-order directional derivative. If this second-order directional derivative were negative in every direction, for instance, we could guarantee that the critical point is a local maximum. A complete justification of the Second Derivative Test requires key ideas from linear algebra that are beyond the scope of this course, so instead of presenting a detailed explanation, we will accept this test as stated. In Activity , we apply the test to more complicated examples.    Find the critical points of the following functions and use the Second Derivative Test to classify the critical points.              .          has a relative minimum at and a saddle point at      has a relative minimum at      has a saddle point at and a relative minimum at         To find the critical points, we determine the points in the domain of where or does not exist. Now , and so when and . The critical points of are then and . To classify these critical points with the Second Derivative Test, we need the second order partial derivatives of . Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us . Then . That and tells us that has a relative minimum at . Also, . That tells us that has a saddle point at .    To find the critical points, we determine the points in the domain of ( and ) where or does not exist. Now , and so when . The first equation tells us that . Substituting into the second equation shows that . So or . This gives us or . Now is not in the domain of , so we only consider . Then . Thus, the only critical point of is . To classify this critical point with the Second Derivative Test, we need the second order partial derivatives of . Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us . Then . That and tells us that has a relative minimum at .    To find the critical points, we determine the points in the domain of where or does not exist. Now , and so when and . Solving these equations simultaneously yields the critical points of and . To classify these critical points with the Second Derivative Test, we need the second order partial derivatives of . Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us . Then . That tells us that has a saddle point at . Also, . Since and , we determine that has a local minimum at .      As we learned in single-variable calculus, finding extremal values of functions can be particularly useful in applied settings. For instance, we can often use calculus to determine the least expensive way to construct something or to find the most efficient route between two locations. The same possibility holds in settings with two or more variables.    While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is often a function of the price of the product, the demand for a product may also depend on the price of other products. For instance, the demand for blue jeans at Old Navy may be affected not only by the price of the jeans themselves, but also by the price of khakis.  Suppose we have two goods whose respective prices are and . The demand for these goods, and , depend on the prices as   The seller would like to set the prices and in order to maximize revenue. We will assume that the seller meets the full demand for each product. Thus, if we let be the revenue obtained by selling items of the first good at price per item and items of the second good at price per item, we have   We can then write the revenue as a function of just the two variables and by using Equations and , giving us   A graph of as a function of and is shown in Figure .   A revenue function.      Find all critical points of the revenue function, . (Hint: You should obtain a system of two equations in two unknowns which can be solved by elimination or substitution.)    Apply the Second Derivative Test to determine the type of any critical point(s).    Where should the seller set the prices and to maximize the revenue?        critical point is      has a relative maximum at the critical point    The price for each item should be set at 25 dollars to maximize the revenue. Note that the maximum revenue is .        To find the critical points we determine where and are simultaneously 0 (since is a polynomial function, the partial derivatives of exist everywhere). Now . The system or is a system of two linear equations in two unknowns. Multiplying both sides of the second equation by and then adding corresponding sides of this new equation with the first equation yields the equation or . Substituting back into the first equation shows that . Thus, our only critical point occurs at .    To apply the second derivative test, we need the second order partial derivatives: . So the discriminant of at the critical point is , and has a relative maximum at the critical point. The graph of indicates an absolute maximum as well at the critical point.    Since has a relative maximum at the critical point, the price for each item should be set at 25 dollars to maximize the revenue. Note that the maximum revenue is .        Optimization on a Restricted Domain  The Second Derivative Test helps us classify critical points of a function, but it does not tell us if the function actually has an absolute maximum or minimum at each such point. For single-variable functions, the Extreme Value Theorem told us that a continuous function on a closed interval always has both an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval, and that these absolute extremes must occur at either an endpoint or at a critical point. Thus, to find the absolute maximum and minimum, we determine the critical points in the interval and then evaluate the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval. A similar approach works for functions of two variables.  For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the role that closed intervals did for functions of a single variable. A closed region is a region that contains its boundary (the unit disk is closed, while its interior is not, for example), while a bounded region is one that does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for functions of a single variable, continuous functions of several variables that are defined on closed, bounded regions must have absolute maxima and minima in those regions.   The Extreme Value Theorem  Let be a continuous function on a closed and bounded region . Then has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in .   The absolute extremes must occur at either a critical point in the interior of or at a boundary point of . We therefore must test both possibilities, as we demonstrate in the following example.    Suppose the temperature at each point on the circular plate is given by   The domain is a closed and bounded region, as shown on the left of Figure , so the Extreme Value Theorem assures us that has an absolute maximum and minimum on the plate. The graph of over its domain is shown in Figure . We will find the hottest and coldest points on the plate.   Domain of the temperature and its graph.       If the absolute maximum or minimum occurs inside the disk, it will be at a critical point so we begin by looking for critical points inside the disk. To do this, notice that critical points are given by the conditions and . This means that there is one critical point of the function at the point , which lies inside the disk.  We now find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary of the disk, which is the circle of radius 1. As we have seen, the points on the unit circle can be parametrized as where . The temperature at a point on the circle is then described by   To find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary, we look for the critical points of this single-variable function on the interval . We have   This shows that we have critical points when or . This occurs when , , , and . Since we have and , the corresponding points are     when ,    when .      when ,    when .     These are the critical points of on the boundary and so this collection of points includes the hottest and coldest points on the boundary.  We now have a list of candidates for the hottest and coldest points: the critical point in the interior of the disk and the critical points on the boundary. We find the hottest and coldest points by evaluating the temperature at each of these points, and find that     ,    ,      ,    .      ,      So the maximum value of on the disk is , which occurs at the two points on the boundary, and the minimum value of on the disk is which occurs at the critical point in the interior of .    From this example, we see that we use the following procedure for determining the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed and bounded domain.   Step 1:  Find all critical points of the function in the interior of the domain.    Step 2:  Find all the critical points of the function on the boundary of the domain. Working on the boundary of the domain reduces this part of the problem to one or more single variable optimization problems. Note that there may be endpoints on portions of the boundary that need to be considered.    Step 3:  Evaluate the function at each of the points found in Steps 1 and 2.    Step 4:  The maximum value of the function is the largest value obtained in Step 3, and the minimum value of the function is the smallest value obtained in Step 3.       Let with triangular domain whose vertices are at , , and . The domain and a graph of on the domain appear in Figure .   The domain of and its graph.         Find all of the critical points of in .    Parameterize the horizontal leg of the triangular domain, and find the critical points of on that leg. (Hint: You may need to consider endpoints.)    Parameterize the vertical leg of the triangular domain, and find the critical points of on that leg. (Hint: You may need to consider endpoints.)    Parameterize the hypotenuse of the triangular domain, and find the critical points of on the hypotenuse. (Hint: You may need to consider endpoints.)    Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of on .              , , and      , , and      and     maximum value of on is 3, minimum value of on is         A direct calculation shows that and . So when and . This point is in the domain and is the only critical point of in .    The base of the triangular domain can be parameterized by , with . Now . The critical points of are the roots of . Now when . This give a critical point of on the base. We also need to consider the endpoints and . When we have and when we have . So there are three points at which can attain a maximum or minimum on the base of the triangular domain: , , and .    The vertical leg of the triangular domain can be parameterized by , with . Now . The critical points of are the roots of . Now when . This give a critical point of on the leg. We also need to consider the endpoints and . When we have and when we have .

The critical points of are the roots of . Now when . This give a critical point of which is not in our domain. We also need to consider the endpoints and . When we have and when we have . So there are two points at which can attain a maximum or minimum on the hypotenuse of the triangular domain: and .    We now only need to compare the values of at the critical points in the interior of and on the boundary of . Now    ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,   so the maximum value of on is 3, occurring at the point and the minimum value of on is , occurring at the point .        Summary    To find the extrema of a function , we first find the critical points, which are points where one of the partials of fails to exist, or where and .    The Second Derivative Test helps determine whether a critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point.    If is defined on a closed and bounded domain, we find the absolute maxima and minima by finding the critical points in the interior of the domain, finding the critical points on the boundary, and testing the value of at both sets of critical points.        The function has a critical point at .  What is the value of at this critical point?

Let in the region where .  Explain why must have a global minimum at some point in (note that is unbounded---how does this influence your explanation?). Then find the global minimum.  minimum =        is continuous in the region , but is not closed and bounded so a special analysis is required. Notice that tends to as tends farther and farther from the origin or tends toward any point on the or axis. This suggests that a minimum for , if it exists, can not be too far from the origin or too close to the axes. For example, if then , and if then . If then , and if then . Since , a global minimum for if it exists must be in the smaller region , . The region is closed and bounded and so have a minimum value at some point in , and since that value is at most 10, it is also a global minimum for all of .

The maximum value of on this disk is 4 and the minimum value is 3.    The point is the point on the plane that lies closest to the origin.       We want to determine when and are simultaneously 0. Now and are 0 when and , where and are integers. We know that is either 1 or depending on whether is even or odd, respectively, and is also 1 or depending on whether is even or odd, respectively. It follows that is , , or . So the maximum value of is 2, which occurs when and for and even. Also, the minimum value of is , which occurs when and for and odd.    Since and exist everywhere, the critical points of occur when and are simultaneously 0. We solve the system by substituting into the first equation. This leads to the critical points and . We use the Second Derivative Test to classify these critical points. Note that . Since and , it follows that has a local minimum at . Also, tells us that has a saddle point at .    We find the points at which and are simultaneously 0. To solve the system we subtract the second equation from the first leaving us with . So either or . If , then the first equation tells us that . In this case we have the critical points and . If , the second equation tells us that . In this case we have critical points and . We use the Second Derivative Test to classify these critical points.

We use the Second Derivative Test with , , and to classify these critical points.   Since and , the function has a relative minimum at .    Since and , the function has a relative maximum at .       First we find the critical points of on the triangular domain. The first order partial derivatives of are . So and when and , giving us a single critical point . This point is in the first quadrant and satisfies , so is in our domain. Next we check the boundaries for , for , and for .   When we have . Since , the only critical point of is . The endpoints of this portion of the boundary are , and , which we also need to check.    When we have . Since , the only critical point of is . The endpoints of this portion of the boundary are , and , which we also need to check.    When we have . Since , the only critical point of is The endpoints of this portion of the boundary are , and , which we also need to check.   Now we test at the critical points and the appropriate points on the boundary: . So the absolute maximum value of on this domain is 4 and the absolute minimum value is .    This is the same function as in the previous part of the problem, so the single critical point of is . Now we check the boundary. We can parameterize the boundary of the disk by and . On this boundary we have . Since , it follows that the maximum value of on this disk is 4 and the minimum value is 3.    A point on the plane has coordinates , so the distance from the origin to a point on the plane is . We want to find the minimum value of . Since cannot be negative, the minimum value of will occur at the same point as the minimum value of . Now and . To solve the system and , we use elimination to obtain the critical point . Now and , so the surface is always concave up. This demonstrates that the point is the point on the plane that lies closest to the origin.      If a continuous function of a single variable has two critical numbers and at which has relative maximum values, then must have another critical number , because it is impossible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. The other critical point can be a saddle point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley). (From Calculus in Vector Spaces by Lawrence J. Corwin and Robert H. Szczarb.) Consider the function defined by . (From Ira Rosenholz in the Problems Section of the Mathematics Magazine , Vol. 60 NO. 1, February 1987.) Show that has exactly two critical points, and that has relative maximum values at each of these critical points. Explain how this function illustrates that it really is possible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by to see graphically how this happens.   The critical points for this function occur when and are simultaneously 0. Now .

With , the second equation tells us that or . This makes or . So our critical points are and .  With , we have .  Since , the Second Derivative Test shows that has a relative maximum value at each of these critical points.  Because has only these two critical points, it is impossible for to have another critical point to make a saddle point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley). So provides an example that it is possible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between.   The critical points for this function occur when and are simultaneously 0. Now .

With , the second equation tells us that or . This makes or . So our critical points are and .  With , we have .  Since , the Second Derivative Test shows that has a relative maximum value at each of these critical points.  Because has only these two critical points, it is impossible for to have another critical point to make a saddle point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley). So provides an example that it is possible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between.    If a continuous function of a single variable has exactly one critical number with a relative maximum at that critical point, then the value of at that critical point is an absolute maximum. In this exercise we see that the same is not always true for functions of two variables. Let (from The Only Critical Point in Town Test by Ira Rosenholz and Lowell Smylie in the Mathematics Magazine , VOL 58 NO 3 May 1985.). Show that has exactly one critical point, has a relative maximum value at that critical point, but that has no absolute maximum value. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by to see graphically how this happens.   The critical points for this function occur when and are simultaneously 0. Now .  To solve the system we multiply both sides of the first equation by and subtract corresponding sides of the second equation to obtain the equation . This makes or . Substituting into the second equation we see that or . This makes or . So our only critical point is .  With , we have .  Since , the Second Derivative Test shows that has a relative maximum value at its single critical point.  Notice that , so does not have an absolute maximum value.   The critical points for this function occur when and are simultaneously 0. Now .  To solve the system we multiply both sides of the first equation by and subtract corresponding sides of the second equation to obtain the equation . This makes or . Substituting into the second equation we see that or . This makes or . So our only critical point is .  With , we have .  Since , the Second Derivative Test shows that has a relative maximum value at its single critical point.  Notice that , so does not have an absolute maximum value.    A manufacturer wants to procure rectangular boxes to ship its product. The boxes must contain 20 cubic feet of space. To be durable enough to ensure the safety of the product, the material for the sides of the boxes will cost $0.10 per square foot, while the material for the top and bottom will cost $0.25 per square foot. In this activity we will help the manufacturer determine the box of minimal cost.   What quantities are constant in this problem? What are the variables in this problem? Provide appropriate variable labels. What, if any, restrictions are there on the variables?    Using your variables from (a), determine a formula for the total cost of a box.    Your formula in part (b) might be in terms of three variables. If so, find a relationship between the variables, and then use this relationship to write as a function of only two independent variables.    Find the dimensions that minimize the cost of a box. Be sure to verify that you have a minimum cost.        The volume of the boxes is constant at 20 cubic feet. The things that can change are the length , width , and height of the box. Since the volume of a box must be positive, all of the variables must be positive as well.    The total area of the sides of a box is , and so the total cost of the sides is . The total area of the top and bottom of a box is , and so the total cost of the top and bottom is . Thus, the total cost of a box is .         The dimensions that minimize cost of box are , and the minimum cost per box is .       The volume of the boxes is constant at 20 cubic feet. The things that can change are the length , width , and height of the box. Since the volume of a box must be positive, all of the variables must be positive as well.    The total area of the sides of a box is , and so the total cost of the sides is . The total area of the top and bottom of a box is , and so the total cost of the top and bottom is . Thus, the total cost of a box is .    We know that the volume of a box must be 20 cubic feet, so . This makes and .    The critical points come from the first order partial derivatives. Now and . Since and must be positive, the only critical points occur when the partials are equal to 0. To solve the system , we solve the first equation for to obtain and substitute into the second, yielding the equation . Since , we can reduce this last equation to , which has solution . The equation then gives us . Then height is then . Now we need to show that we obtain a minimum cost at this point. To find the discriminant, we need the second order partial derivatives of . Note that , so the discriminant of at point is . So and the fact that means that we have a relative minimum value for at the point . The graph of indicates that the cost at the point is a global minimum. The minimum cost per box is .      A rectangular box with length , width , and height is being built. The box is positioned so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the box lies in the first octant where , , and are all positive. There is an added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit underneath the plane with equation . In fact, we will assume that the corner of the box opposite the origin must actually lie on this plane. The basic problem is to find the maximum volume of the box.   Sketch the plane , as well as a picture of a potential box. Label everything appropriately.    Explain how you can use the fact that one corner of the box lies on the plane to write the volume of the box as a function of and only. Do so, and clearly show the formula you find for .    Find all critical points of . (Note that when finding the critical points, it is essential that you factor first to make the algebra easier.)    Without considering the current applied nature of the function , classify each critical point you found above as a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point of .    Determine the maximum volume of the box, justifying your answer completely with an appropriate discussion of the critical points of the function.    Now suppose that we instead stipulated that, while the vertex of the box opposite the origin still had to lie on the plane, we were only going to permit the sides of the box, and , to have values in a specified range (given below). That is, we now want to find the maximum value of on the closed, bounded region Find the maximum volume of the box under this condition, justifying your answer fully.        A sketch with the length , width , and height of the box labeled is shown below.    If and are the first two coordinates of the a point on the box farthest from the origin, then the height of the box is the corresponding coordinate of the point on the plane. Therefore, the volume of the box is .    The critical points are , , , and .     has a saddle point at , a saddle point at , a saddle point at , and a relative maximum at .    the maximum volume of the box is     We have already found the critical points of , and none of them satisfy the restrictions. So the maximum value of under these conditions occurs on the boundary.   When we have . So and has a critical point when . So we have check the values of at the critical point and the endpoints and .    When we have . So and has a critical point when . So we have check the values of at the critical point and the endpoints and .    When we have . So and has a critical point when . But this value of is outside of our domain, so we don't consider it. So we have check the values of at the endpoints and .    When we have . So and has a critical point when . So we have check the values of at the critical point and the endpoints and .   The values of at these points on the boundary are          ,   on this domain.       A sketch with the length , width , and height of the box labeled is shown below.    If and are the first two coordinates of the a point on the box farthest from the origin, then the height of the box is the corresponding coordinate of the point on the plane. Therefore, the volume of the box is .    The first order partial derivatives of are . So implies that or and implies that or . We consider each case in turn.   If , then and . So the critical points are and .    If , then and . So or , giving us the critical points and .    If , then and . So the critical points are and .    If , then and . So or , giving us the critical points and .   So the critical points of are , , , and .    We use the Second Derivative Test with . Considering each critical point in turn we have    , so has a saddle point at ,     , so has a saddle point at ,     , so has a saddle point at ,     and , so has a relative maximum at .       In order to have non-negative values of all variables we must restrict the domain of to the first octant with or and . We have already determined the critical points of , so now it remains to check the values of at the critical points against the appropriate points on the boundary.   When we have .    When we have .    When we have .   So the maximum value of will occur at one of the critical points found in the previous part of this problem. Since and , the maximum volume of the box is .    We have already found the critical points of , and none of them satisfy the restrictions. So the maximum value of under these conditions occurs on the boundary.   When we have . So and has a critical point when . So we have check the values of at the critical point and the endpoints and .    When we have . So and has a critical point when . So we have check the values of at the critical point and the endpoints and .    When we have . So and has a critical point when . But this value of is outside of our domain, so we don't consider it. So we have check the values of at the endpoints and .    When we have . So and has a critical point when . So we have check the values of at the critical point and the endpoints and .   The values of at these points on the boundary are          ,   on this domain.      The airlines place restrictions on luggage that can be carried onto planes.   A carry-on bag can weigh no more than 40 lbs.    The length plus width plus height of a bag cannot exceed 45 inches.    The bag must fit in an overhead bin.     Let , , and be the length, width, and height (in inches) of a carry on bag. In this problem we find the dimensions of the bag of largest volume, , that satisfies the second restriction. Assume that we use all 45 inches to get a maximum volume. (Note that this bag of maximum volume might not satisfy the third restriction.)   Write the volume as a function of just the two variables and .    Explain why the domain over which is defined is the triangular region with vertices (0,0), (45,0), and (0,45).    Find the critical points, if any, of in the interior of the region .    Find the maximum value of on the boundary of the region , and then determine the dimensions of a bag with maximum volume on the entire region . (Note that most carry-on bags sold today measure by by inches with a volume of cubic inches, so that the bags will fit into the overhead bins.)             We cannot have negative length, so and . Since , this makes . So our domain is the triangular region with vertices (0,0), (45,0), and (0,45).         The maximum value of must occur at the point . Since we have and so the largest volume is cubic inches. The dimensions of the bag are 15 inches long by 15 inches wide by 15 inches high.       The second restriction is that (assume we use all 45 inches to obtain a maximum volume). Thus, and .    We cannot have negative length, so and . Since , this makes . So our domain is the triangular region with vertices (0,0), (45,0), and (0,45).    The critical points of are the points where or either or is undefined. Since is a polynomial, the only critical points will occur when and . This gives us the equations . We can factor a from the first equation and an from the second to obtain . Note that if , , or , then and we have a minimum volume. So assume and . Then we need to solve the system . Subtracting 2 times the second equation from the first gives . So . Substituting back into the second equation gives or . Then as well.    We need to compare the value of at the one critical point against the values of on the boundary of the domain. The boundary of our domain consists of the segment between and , the segment between and , and the segment between and . On we have , and . On we have , and . On we have , so and the volume is also 0. So we only get minimum values on the boundary. Therefore, the maximum value of must occur at the point . Since we have and so the largest volume is cubic inches.        According to The Song of Insects by G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press, 1948) the sound of striped ground crickets chirping, in number of chirps per second, is related to the temperature. So the number of chirps per second could be a predictor of temperature. The data Pierce collected is shown in Table ., where is the (average) number of chirps per second and is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  A scatterplot of the data would show that, while the relationship between and is not exactly linear, it looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear, but only approximately linear.    Crickets chirping.                                                                      If we want to use the data to make predications, then we need to fit a curve of some kind to the data. Since the cricket data appears roughly linear, we will fit a linear function of the form to the data. We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of the squares of the distances between the values of the data and the corresponding values of the line defined by . This type of fit is called a least squares approximation. If the data is represented by the points , , , , then the square of the distance between and is . So our goal is to minimize the sum of these squares, of minimize the function defined by    Calculate and .    Solve the system and to show that the critical point satisfies (Hint: Don't be daunted by these expressions, the system and is a system of two linear equations in the unknowns and . It might be easier to let , , , and and write your equations using these constants.)    Use the Second Derivative Test to explain why the critical point gives a local minimum. Can you then explain why the critical point gives an absolute minimum?

Our goal in this activity is to understand a similar test for classifying extreme values of functions of two variables.

  "body": "   According to The Song of Insects by G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press, 1948) the sound of striped ground crickets chirping, in number of chirps per second, is related to the temperature. So the number of chirps per second could be a predictor of temperature. The data Pierce collected is shown in Table ., where is the (average) number of chirps per second and is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  A scatterplot of the data would show that, while the relationship between and is not exactly linear, it looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear, but only approximately linear.

Since the cricket data appears roughly linear, we will fit a linear function of the form to the data. We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of the squares of the distances between the values of the data and the corresponding values of the line defined by . This type of fit is called a least squares approximation. If the data is represented by the points , , , , then the square of the distance between and is .

  "body": " Constrained Optimization: Lagrange Multipliers     What geometric condition enables us to optimize a function subject to a constraint given by , where is a constant?    How can we exploit this geometric condition to find the extreme values of a function subject to a constraint?      We previously considered how to find the extreme values of functions on both unrestricted domains and on closed, bounded domains. Other types of optimization problems involve maximizing or minimizing a quantity subject to an external constraint. In these cases the extreme values frequently won't occur at the points where the gradient is zero, but rather at other points that satisfy an important geometric condition. These problems are often called constrained optimization problems and can be solved with the method of Lagrange Multipliers, which we study in this section.    According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by girth we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. Our goal is to find the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail. (We solved this applied optimization problem in single variable Active Calculus , so it may look familiar. We take a different approach in this section, and this approach allows us to view most applied optimization problems from single variable calculus as constrained optimization problems, as well as provide us tools to solve a greater variety of optimization problems.) If we let be the length of the side of one square end of the package and the length of the package, then we want to maximize the volume of the box subject to the constraint that the girth ( ) plus the length ( ) is as large as possible, or . The equation is thus an external constraint on the variables.    The constraint equation involves the function that is given by Explain why the constraint is a contour of , and is therefore a two-dimensional curve.  Contours of and the constraint equation .        Figure shows the graph of the constraint equation along with a few contours of the volume function . Since our goal is to find the maximum value of subject to the constraint , we want to find the point on our constraint curve that intersects the contours of at which has its largest value.    Points and in Figure lie on a contour of and on the constraint equation . Explain why neither nor provides a maximum value of that satisfies the constraint.    Points and in Figure lie on a contour of and on the constraint equation . Explain why neither nor provides a maximum value of that satisfies the constraint.    Based on your responses to parts i. and ii., draw the contour of on which you believe will achieve a maximum value subject to the constraint . Explain why you drew the contour you did.      Recall that is a contour of the function , and that the gradient of a function is always orthogonal to its contours. With this in mind, how should and be related at the optimal point? Explain.        A contour is a curve obtained by setting the dependent variable equal to a constant. So if , then the equation is a contour of .    Notice that there are contours of that intersect the constraint with higher values of than occur at points , , , or . It appears that that maximum value of that we want will occur at a point where the contour of intersects the constraint at only one point or when the contour of is tangent to the constraint.    When the graph of the constraint is tangent to a level curve of , then the two curves will have the same direction at this point. This implies any two vectors that are orthogonal to these level curves will have to be parallel at the point of tangency. So and will have to be parallel at the point of tangency.        A contour is a curve obtained by setting the dependent variable equal to a constant. So if , then the equation is a contour of .    Notice that there are contours of that intersect the constraint with higher values of than occur at points , , , or . It appears that that maximum value of that we want will occur at a point where the contour of intersects the constraint at only one point or when the contour of is tangent to the constraint.    When the graph of the constraint is tangent to a level curve of , then the two curves will have the same direction at this point. This implies any two vectors that are orthogonal to these level curves will have to be parallel at the point of tangency. So and will have to be parallel at the point of tangency.        Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipliers  In Preview Activity , we considered an optimization problem where there is an external constraint on the variables, namely that the girth plus the length of the package cannot exceed 108 inches. We saw that we can create a function from the constraint, specifically . The constraint equation is then just a contour of , , where is a constant (in our case 108). Figure illustrates that the volume function is maximized, subject to the constraint , when the graph of is tangent to a contour of . Moreover, the value of on this contour is the sought maximum value.   Contours of and the constraint contour.    To find this point where the graph of the constraint is tangent to a contour of , recall that is perpendicular to the contours of and is perpendicular to the contour of . At such a point, the vectors and are parallel, and thus we need to determine the points where this occurs. Recall that two vectors are parallel if one is a nonzero scalar multiple of the other, so we therefore look for values of a parameter that make   The constant is called a Lagrange multiplier Lagrange multiplier .  To find the values of that satisfy for the volume function in Preview Activity , we calculate both and . Observe that and thus we need a value of so that   Equating components in the most recent equation and incorporating the original constraint, we have three equations in the three unknowns , , and . First, note that if , then equation shows that . From this, Equation tells us that . So the point is a point we need to consider. Next, provided that (from which it follows that by Equation ), we may divide both sides of Equation by the corresponding sides of to eliminate , and thus find that   Substituting into Equation gives us or   Thus we have and as another point to consider. So the points at which the gradients of and are parallel, and thus at which may have a maximum or minimum subject to the constraint, are and . By evaluating the function at these points, we see that we maximize the volume when the length of the square end of the box is 18 inches and the length is 36 inches, for a maximum volume of cubic inches. Since , we obtain a minimum value at this point.  We summarize the process of Lagrange multipliers as follows.   The method of Lagrange multipliers  The general technique for optimizing a function subject to a constraint is to solve the system and for , , and . We then evaluate the function at each point that results from a solution to the system in order to find the optimum values of subject to the constraint.     A cylindrical soda can holds about 355 cc of liquid. In this activity, we want to find the dimensions of such a can that will minimize the surface area. For the sake of simplicity, assume the can is a perfect cylinder.   What are the variables in this problem? Based on the context, what restriction(s), if any, are there on these variables?    What quantity do we want to optimize in this problem? What equation describes the constraint? (You need to decide which of these functions plays the role of and which plays the role of in our discussion of Lagrange multipliers.)    Find and the values of your variables that satisfy Equation in the context of this problem.    Determine the dimensions of the pop can that give the desired solution to this constrained optimization problem.         Assume the pop can is cylindrical. Let by the radius and the height of the can. The volume of the can is constant at 355 cc of liquid. The radius and height can be any positive numbers as long as the volume is 355.    We want to minimize the surface area of the can, where . The volume of the can is , so our constraint is .    We find . This makes and .    To minimize the surface area under the assumptions we have made, the radius should be approximately 3.84 cm and the height approximately 7.66 cm.        Assume the pop can is cylindrical. Let by the radius and the height of the can. The volume of the can is constant at 355 cc of liquid. The radius and height can be any positive numbers as long as the volume is 355.    We want to minimize the surface area of the can, where . The volume of the can is , so our constraint is .    To solve this constrained optimization problem, we need to find the values of , , and that satisfy . So we have to solve the equations . Since , these equations simplify to . So . Now , so equation becomes . Applying some algebra yields . This makes and .    To minimize the surface area under the assumptions we have made, the radius should be approximately 3.84 cm and the height approximately 7.66 cm.      The method of Lagrange multipliers also works for functions of more than two variables.    Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the dimensions of the least expensive packing crate with a volume of 240 cubic feet when the material for the top costs $2 per square foot, the bottom is $3 per square foot and the sides are $1.50 per square foot.    To minimize the cost of this crate, the crate should be a box of approximate dimensions feet.    We want to minimize the cost of the crate. Let be the length, the width, and the height of the crate. The volume of the crate is to be 240 cubic feet, so , , and . The area of the top and bottom of the crate is , so the cost of the top of the crate is and the cost of the bottom is . The area of the sides of the crate is and so the cost of the sides is . Thus, the total cost of the crate is .  The volume of the crate is to be 240 cubic feet, so our constraint is .  Now implies .  So we need to solve the system of equations .  The last three equations give us .  Using the fact that we have .  Using the equation gives us .  Then we substitute into the equation .  Then and .  Also, .  So to minimize the cost of this crate, the crate should be a box of approximate dimensions feet.    The method of Lagrange multipliers also works for functions of three variables. That is, if we have a function that we want to optimize subject to a constraint , the optimal point lies on the level surface defined by the constraint . As we did in Preview Activity , we can argue that the optimal value occurs at the level surface that is tangent to . Thus, the gradients of and are parallel at this optimal point. So, just as in the two variable case, we can optimize subject to the constraint by finding all points that satisfy and .    Summary    The extrema of a function subject to a constraint occur at points for which the contour of is tangent to the curve that represents the constraint equation. This occurs when     We use the condition to generate a system of equations, together with the constraint , that may be solved for , , and . Once we have all the solutions, we evaluate at each of the points to determine the extrema.        Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and minimum values of subject to the constraint , if such values exist.  maximum =  minimum =  (For either value, enter DNE if there is no such value.)             and our equation of constraint is . To optimize with Lagrange multipliers we solve the following system of equations  and Solving for gives us which we can use to find in terms of : Using this relation in our equation of constraint, we can solve for : so and thus So, solving for , we have , and . Thus, the critical points are and . Since the constraint is closed and bounded, maximum and minimum values of subject to the constraint exist. Evaluating at the critical points, we find that the maximum value is and the minimum value is .        Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and minimum values of , subject to the constraint  maximum =  minimum =  (For either value, enter DNE if there is no such value.)             : From the first equation, we get either or . If , from the second equation we get , so . If instead , then from the second equation . We conclude that the critical points are , , and . All three critical points satisfy the constraint . The Lagrange conditions, , are: From the first equation, when , we divide by to get . Substituting into the second equation, we get Then using from the constraint, we have so . Factoring, we get , so or . From the constraint, we get when and for . If instead , so that we cannot divide by in the first Lagrange equation, then from the constraint, . Summarizing, the following points are either critical points or satisfy the Lagrange conditions: These are the candidates for global maximum or minimum points. The corresponding values for are: The largest value is at the point , and the smallest value is at ,        Find the absolute maximum and minimum of the function subject to the constraint .

Find the minimum distance from the point to the paraboloid given by the equation .  Minimum distance =  Note: If you need to find roots of a polynomial of degree , you may want to use a calculator of computer to do so numerically. Also be sure that you can give a geometric justification for your answer.        be a point on the paraboloid. The square of the distance from to the point is given by and so we wish to minimize subject to the constraint We look for solutions to the equations and :   and If , the first three equations would imply that , which does not satisfy the fourth equation and so . If collect terms in and in the first and second equations, respectively, we get and Note that we cannot have , or , and so can divide these two equation to solve for , getting . If we divide the first and third equations we got from the Lagrange multipliers method, we have so that We can then plug all of these into the last equation, the constraint. This gives Multiplying by and collecting terms, we have Let . Clearly , , and . Thus there must be roots lying between and , between and , and between and . We can locate these numerically using a calculator or computer program, to find Then, using the equations for and in terms of , we have the corresponding values of and , and therefore have three solutions to the Lagrange multiplier equations:  and The distances (squared) from the paraboloid are  and so that the minimum distance is . Note that the geometric interpretation of this is that it is the length of a perpendicular line segment drawn from the paraboloid to the point.        For each value of the function has a minimum value .  (a) Find    (Use the letter L for in your expression.)  (b) For which value of is the largest, and what is that maximum value?    maximum   (c) Find the minimum value of subject to the constraint using the method of Lagrange multipliers and evaluate .  minimum =    (How are these results related to your result in part (b)?)

At this point, and . (c) We want to minimize subject to the constraint , where . The method of Lagrange multipliers has us solve  and We can see that this gives the same solutions for and as we obtained in part (a), and then, plugging in to the third equation, we have Thus we get the same as before: , so that the minimum value of is , where , or . Note that the two question have the same answer. This makes sense, because in the first problem the largest minimum value will clearly occur when , which is the constraint in the third equation.

(b) A similar argument shows that has its minimum value subject to when Then the minimum value is         The Cobb-Douglas production function Cobb-Douglas production function is used in economics to model production levels based on labor and equipment. Suppose we have a specific Cobb-Douglas function of the form where is the dollar amount spent on labor and the dollar amount spent on equipment. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to determine how much should be spent on labor and how much on equipment to maximize productivity if we have a total of 1.5 million dollars to invest in labor and equipment.   We maximize our output when we spend $0.6 million on labor and $0.9 million on equipment.   To find the values of that satisfy for our Cobb-Douglas function, we calculate both and . Now , so we need a value of so that .  Equating components and the original constraint give us the three equations in the three unknowns , , and . Dividing both sides of by the corresponding sides of yields   Substituting into gives us or .  Then and . Therefore we maximize our output when we spend $0.6 million on labor and $0.9 million on equipment.    Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the point on the line that is closest to the point . To do so, respond to the following prompts.   Write the function that measures the square of the distance from to . (The extrema of this function are the same as the extrema of the distance function, but is simpler to work with.)    What is the constraint ?    Write the equations resulting from and the constraint. Find all the points satisfying these equations.    Test all the points you found to determine the extrema.        The square of the distance from to is given by .    The constraint is that the point lies on the line , so .    Since and , the equations resulting from and the constraint are . Substituting for in the second equation yields or . Adding corresponding sides of this new equation with the third equation gives us or . Then .    This single critical point gives us an extreme distance of . This is the only extreme value and since points on the plane can be found as far as possible from the point , we have found the minimum distance.       The square of the distance from to is given by .    The constraint is that the point lies on the line , so .    Since and , the equations resulting from and the constraint are . Substituting for in the second equation yields or . Adding corresponding sides of this new equation with the third equation gives us or . Then .    This single critical point gives us an extreme distance of . This is the only extreme value and since points on the plane can be found as far as possible from the point , we have found the minimum distance.      Apply the Method of Lagrange Multipliers to solve each of the following constrained optimization problems.   Determine the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of subject to the constraint that .    Determine the points on the sphere that are closest to and farthest from the point . (As in the preceding exercise, you may find it simpler to work with the square of the distance formula, rather than the distance formula itself.)    Find the absolute maximum and minimum of subject to the constraint that . (Hint: here the constraint is a closed, bounded region. Use the boundary of that region for applying Lagrange Multipliers, but don't forget to also test any critical values of the function that lie in the interior of the region.)        The maximum value of subject to this constraint is and occurs at the point while the minimum value is and occurs at .    The point on the sphere closest to is and the point on the sphere farthest from is .    The absolute maximum value of on the domain is and the absolute minimum value is 0.       Here we have , so the system of equations resulting from and the constraint is . Dividing corresponding sides of the first equation by the second shows that or . Simplifying yields . Substituting into the constraint equation gives us or . Checking the values of at these critical points we see that . So the maximum value of subject to this constraint is and occurs at the point while the minimum value is and occurs at .    The square of the distance from to is given by . The constraint is .

Simplifying yields . Substituting into the constraint equation gives us . The quadratic formula reveals that . Checking the values of at these critical points we see that . So the absolute maximum value of on the domain is and the absolute minimum value is 0.      In this exercise we consider how to apply the Method of Lagrange Multipliers to optimize functions of three variable subject to two constraints. Suppose we want to optimize subject to the constraints and . Also suppose that the two level surfaces and intersect at a curve . The optimum point will then lie on .   Assume that can be represented parametrically by a vector-valued function . Let . Use the Chain Rule applied to , , and , to explain why Explain how this shows that , , and are all orthogonal to at . This shows that , , and all lie in the same plane.    Assuming that and are nonzero and not parallel, explain why every point in the plane determined by and has the form for some scalars and .    Parts (a.) and (b.) show that there must exist scalars and such that So to optimize subject to the constraints and we must solve the system of equations for , , , , and .  Use this idea to find the maximum and minimum values of subject to the constraints and .        Let be given by the vector function , and set . Now let . Since is an extremum of on the curve , we must have at . By Chain Rule . Thus .  Note that along the curve , and , so both functions are constant. Thus their rate of change must be and so we have . Again by Chain Rule and so . Similarly .  Note that is the tangent vector to at . Thus the above results show that , and are all orthogonal to the tangent vector of since the dot product of each of these with the tangent vector is . Thus all three of these gradient vectors are orthogonal to at and therefore they all lie in the same plane.    We are considering the plane that contains the point as well as the non-parallel vectors and . Note that we could compute the cross product of these vectors to find a normal vector of the plane, then use that to write an equation of the plane. Here we claim (informally) that any point in the plane can be obtained by starting at , moving some distance in the direction of and then moving some distance in the direction of . In other words, an arbitrary point in the plane can be expressed as . (Using ideas from linear algebra, we claim that the plane determined by and is the span of these two vectors, and thus every point in the plane can be expressed as a linear combination of these two vectors.)    For this exercise we have , and . Thus , and . Therefore the system of equations we have to solve is or . From the first equation we get . Plugging that into the second and third equations above yields and , with . Substituting these values into the fourth equation above gives us . Simplifying yields , and so we find . If , we have and . Substituting these values into the fifth equation above yields . Following the same approach for yields , and .  Finally, we use these values to find the maximum and minimum of subject to the constraints. Since , we have and . So, subject to the given constraints, the maximum of is 14 and the minimum of is 6.       Let be given by the vector function , and set . Now let . Since is an extremum of on the curve , we must have at . By Chain Rule . Thus .  Note that along the curve , and , so both functions are constant. Thus their rate of change must be and so we have . Again by Chain Rule and so . Similarly .  Note that is the tangent vector to at . Thus the above results show that , and are all orthogonal to the tangent vector of since the dot product of each of these with the tangent vector is . Thus all three of these gradient vectors are orthogonal to at and therefore they all lie in the same plane.    We are considering the plane that contains the point as well as the non-parallel vectors and . Note that we could compute the cross product of these vectors to find a normal vector of the plane, then use that to write an equation of the plane. Here we claim (informally) that any point in the plane can be obtained by starting at , moving some distance in the direction of and then moving some distance in the direction of . In other words, an arbitrary point in the plane can be expressed as . (Using ideas from linear algebra, we claim that the plane determined by and is the span of these two vectors, and thus every point in the plane can be expressed as a linear combination of these two vectors.)    For this exercise we have , and . Thus , and . Therefore the system of equations we have to solve is or . From the first equation we get . Plugging that into the second and third equations above yields and , with . Substituting these values into the fourth equation above gives us . Simplifying yields , and so we find . If , we have and . Substituting these values into the fifth equation above yields . Following the same approach for yields , and .  Finally, we use these values to find the maximum and minimum of subject to the constraints. Since , we have and . So, subject to the given constraints, the maximum of is 14 and the minimum of is 6.      There is a useful interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier . Assume that we want to optimize a function with constraint . Recall that an optimal solution occurs at a point where .

Again by Chain Rule and so . Similarly .  Note that is the tangent vector to at . Thus the above results show that , and are all orthogonal to the tangent vector of since the dot product of each of these with the tangent vector is . Thus all three of these gradient vectors are orthogonal to at and therefore they all lie in the same plane.    We are considering the plane that contains the point as well as the non-parallel vectors and . Note that we could compute the cross product of these vectors to find a normal vector of the plane, then use that to write an equation of the plane. Here we claim (informally) that any point in the plane can be obtained by starting at , moving some distance in the direction of and then moving some distance in the direction of . In other words, an arbitrary point in the plane can be expressed as . (Using ideas from linear algebra, we claim that the plane determined by and is the span of these two vectors, and thus every point in the plane can be expressed as a linear combination of these two vectors.)    For this exercise we have , and . Thus , and . Therefore the system of equations we have to solve is or . From the first equation we get . Plugging that into the second and third equations above yields and , with . Substituting these values into the fourth equation above gives us . Simplifying yields , and so we find . If , we have and . Substituting these values into the fifth equation above yields . Following the same approach for yields , and .

  "body": " Double Riemann Sums and Double Integrals over Rectangles     What is a double Riemann sum?    How is the double integral of a continuous function defined?    What are two things the double integral of a function can tell us?      In single-variable calculus, recall that we approximated the area under the graph of a positive function on an interval by adding areas of rectangles whose heights are determined by the curve. The general process involved subdividing the interval into smaller subintervals, constructing rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on that subinterval, then summing the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. We will extend this process in this section to its three-dimensional analogs, double Riemann sums and double integrals over rectangles.    In this activity we introduce the concept of a double Riemann sum.    Review the concept of the Riemann sum from single-variable calculus. Then, explain how we define the definite integral of a continuous function of a single variable on an interval . Include a sketch of a continuous function on an interval with appropriate labeling in order to illustrate your definition.    In our upcoming study of integral calculus for multivariable functions, we will first extend the idea of the single-variable definite integral to functions of two variables over rectangular domains. To do so, we will need to understand how to partition a rectangle into subrectangles. Let be rectangular domain (we can also represent this domain with the notation ), as pictured in Figure .  Rectangular domain with subrectangles.     To form a partition of the full rectangular region, , we will partition both intervals and ; in particular, we choose to partition the interval into three uniformly sized subintervals and the interval into two evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure . In the following questions, we discuss how to identify the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.    Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. What is the length of each subinterval for from 1 to 3?    Explicitly identify , , , and . On Figure or your own version of the diagram, label these endpoints.    Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. What is the length of each subinterval for from 1 to 2? Identify , , and and label these endpoints on Figure .    Let denote the subrectangle . Appropriately label each subrectangle in your drawing of Figure . How does the total number of subrectangles depend on the partitions of the intervals and ?    What is area of each subrectangle?          We approximated the area under the graph of a positive function on an interval by adding areas of rectangles. The process was to subdivide the interval into smaller subintervals, construct rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on that subinterval, then use the sum of the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. In more detail, we started with a continuous function on a closed interval . We then partitioned the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . We chose a point in each subinterval and constructed a rectangle with base the interval and height . The area of the rectangle is . We then approximate the area under the curve defined by on the interval by the sum . If we let go to infinity, we obtain the exact area under the curve and call this the definite integral of on the interval : .    We determine the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.   Since these partition points are uniformly spaced, the distance between them is .    Because , we have . These points are labeled in the figure below.     Here we have , and so . These points are labeled in the figure above.    If we partition the interval into subintervals and the interval into subintervals, that will partition the rectangle into subintervals. The subrectangles for our particular partition are labeled in the figure above.    The area of a rectangle is length times width, so .           We approximated the area under the graph of a positive function on an interval by adding areas of rectangles. The process was to subdivide the interval into smaller subintervals, construct rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on that subinterval, then use the sum of the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. In more detail, we started with a continuous function on a closed interval . We then partitioned the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . We chose a point in each subinterval and constructed a rectangle with base the interval and height . The area of the rectangle is .

These points are labeled in the figure below.     Here we have , and so . These points are labeled in the figure above.    If we partition the interval into subintervals and the interval into subintervals, that will partition the rectangle into subintervals. The subrectangles for our particular partition are labeled in the figure above.    The area of a rectangle is length times width, so .           Double Riemann Sums over Rectangles  For the definite integral in single-variable calculus, we considered a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval . In multivariable calculus, we will eventually develop the idea of a definite integral over a closed, bounded region (such as the interior of a circle). We begin with a simpler situation by thinking only about rectangular domains, and will address more complicated domains in Section .  Let be a continuous function defined on a rectangular domain . As we saw in Preview Activity , the domain is a rectangle and we want to partition into subrectangles. We do this by partitioning each of the intervals and into subintervals and using those subintervals to create a partition of into subrectangles. In the first activity, we address the quantities and notations we will use in order to define double Riemann sums and double integrals.    Let be defined on the rectangular domain . Partition the interval into four uniformly sized subintervals and the interval into three evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure . As we did in Preview Activity , we will need a method for identifying the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.   Rectangular domain with subrectangles.

The partitions of the intervals and partition the rectangle into subrectangles. How many subrectangles are there?    Let denote the subrectangle . Label each subrectangle in Figure .    What is area of each subrectangle?    Now let and . Let be the point in the upper right corner of the subrectangle . Identify and correctly label this point in Figure . Calculate the product Explain, geometrically, what this product represents.    For each and , choose a point in the subrectangle . Identify and correctly label these points in Figure . Explain what the product represents.    If we were to add all the values for each and , what does the resulting number approximate about the surface defined by on the domain ? (You don't actually need to add these values.)    Write a double sum using summation notation that expresses the arbitrary sum from part ( ).        The points , , , , and are labeled in the picture below.

The 12 subrectangles are labeled in the figure below.          With and , we have and . So as shown in the figure below. Then . This result represents the volume of a box with height and base given by the rectangle .      represents the volume of a box with height and base given by one of the subrectangles.     If we add all the values for each and , the resulting number approximates the volume of the solid bounded above by the surface defined by and below by the rectangle .             The points , , , , and are labeled in the picture below.     The length of the interval is , and we are dividing the interval into 4 subintervals of equal length. So the length of each subinterval is .    The points , , , and are labeled in the picture below.     The length of the interval is , and we are dividing the interval into 3 subintervals of equal length. So the length of each subinterval is .    We have 4 subintervals in the direction and 3 in the direction, partitioning the rectangle into subrectangles.    As examples, the subrectangle is , the lower left subrectangle and the subrectangle is , the subrectangle to the right of subrectangle . The 12 subrectangles are labeled in the figure below.     Since each subrectangle has side lengths and , the area of each subrectangle is .    With and , we have and . So as shown in the figure below. Then .

If we add all the values for each and , the resulting number approximates the volume of the solid bounded above by the surface defined by and below by the rectangle .    A double sum that expresses the arbitrary sum from part ( ) is .        Double Riemann Sums and Double Integrals  Now we use the process from the most recent activity to formally define double Riemann sums and double integrals.    Let be a continuous function on a rectangle . A double Riemann sum for over double Riemann sum is created as follows.   -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle into subrectangles with opposite vertices and for between and and between and . These rectangles all have equal area .    Choose a point in each rectangle . Then, a double Riemann sum for over is given by        If on the rectangle , we may ask to find the volume of the solid bounded above by over , as illustrated on the left of Figure . This volume is approximated by a Riemann sum, which sums the volumes of the rectangular boxes shown on the right of Figure .   The volume under a graph approximated by a Riemann Sum.       As we let the number of subrectangles increase without bound (in other words, as both and in a double Riemann sum go to infinity), as illustrated in Figure , the sum of the volumes of the rectangular boxes approaches the volume of the solid bounded above by over . The value of this limit, provided it exists, is the double integral.   Finding better approximations by using smaller subrectangles.         Let be a rectangular region in the -plane and a continuous function over . With terms defined as in a double Riemann sum, the double integral of over double integral definition is     Some textbooks use the notation for a double integral. You will see this in some of the WeBWorK problems.    Interpretation of Double Riemann Sums and Double integrals.  At the moment, there are two ways we can interpret the value of the double integral.   Suppose that assumes both positive and negatives values on the rectangle , as shown on the left of Figure . When constructing a Riemann sum, for each and , the product can be interpreted as a signed volume of a box with base area and signed height . Since can have negative values, this height could be negative. The sum can then be interpreted as a sum of signed volumes of boxes, with a negative sign attached to those boxes whose heights are below the -plane.  The integral measures signed volume.      We can then realize the double integral as a difference in volumes double integral difference in volumes : tells us the volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the rectangle minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the rectangle . This is shown on the right of Figure .    The average of the finitely many values that we take in a double Riemann sum is given by If we take the limit as and go to infinity, we obtain what we define as the average value double integral average value of over the region , which is connected to the value of the double integral. First, to view as a double Riemann sum, note that Thus, where denotes the area of the rectangle . Then, the average value of the function over , , is given by Therefore, the double integral of over divided by the area of gives us the average value of the function on . Finally, if on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the box with base that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .       Let and let .   Draw a picture of . Partition into 2 subintervals of equal length and the interval into two subintervals of equal length. Draw these partitions on your picture of and label the resulting subrectangles using the labeling scheme we established in the definition of a double Riemann sum.    For each and , let be the midpoint of the rectangle . Identify the coordinates of each . Draw these points on your picture of .    Calculate the Riemann sum using the partitions we have described. If we let be the midpoint of the rectangle for each and , then the resulting Riemann sum is called a midpoint sum .    Give two interpretations for the meaning of the sum you just calculated.         The partition of into 2 subintervals of equal length yields endpoints , and , while the partition of the interval into two subintervals of equal length produces endpoints , , and . The partitions of the intervals divide the rectangle into subrectangles of area 1 as shown in the figure below.     The point is the midpoint of the rectangle , and so . Similarly, we have , , and . These points are shown in the figure below.          Since on , the sum in part (b) approximates the volume of the solid bounded above by the graph of and below by the rectangle . In addition, the sum also approximates the average value of on times the area of .        The partition of into 2 subintervals of equal length yields endpoints , and , while the partition of the interval into two subintervals of equal length produces endpoints , , and . The partitions of the intervals divide the rectangle into subrectangles of area 1 as shown in the figure below.     The point is the midpoint of the rectangle , and so . Similarly, we have , , and . These points are shown in the figure below.     Writing out the terms and calculating yields .    Since on , the sum in part (b) approximates the volume of the solid bounded above by the graph of and below by the rectangle . In addition, the sum also approximates the average value of on times the area of .        Let on the rectangular domain . Partition into 3 equal length subintervals and into 2 equal length subintervals. A table of values of at some points in is given in Table , and a graph of with the indicated partitions is shown in Figure .    Table of values of .                                                                       Graph of on .       Sketch the region in the plane using the values in Table as the partitions.    Calculate the double Riemann sum using the given partition of and the values of in the upper right corner of each subrectangle.    Use geometry to calculate the exact value of and compare it to your approximation. Describe one way we could obtain a better approximation using the given data.        The endpoints of the partition of are , , , and , while the endpoints of the partition of are , , and . This makes subrectangles , , , , , . These subrectangles are outlined in the table below.          Since the cross sections parallel to the -plane are semi-circles of radius 2, we can multiply the area of a cross section by the width to obtain the volume. So the exact volume of this object is . We could get a better approximation by using finer partitions.        The endpoints of the partition of are , , , and , while the endpoints of the partition of are , , and . This makes subrectangles , , , , , . These subrectangles are outlined in the table below.     Choosing points in the upper right corner of each subrectangle gives us , , , , , and . So .    Since the cross sections parallel to the -plane are semi-circles of radius 2, we can multiply the area of a cross section by the width to obtain the volume. So the exact volume of this object is . We could get a better approximation by using finer partitions.      We conclude this section with a list of properties of double integrals. Since similar properties are satisfied by single-variable integrals and the arguments for double integrals are essentially the same, we omit their justification.   Properties of Double Integrals  Let and be continuous functions on a rectangle , and let be a constant. Then    .     .    If on , then .        Summary    Let be a continuous function on a rectangle . The double Riemann sum for over is created as follows.   -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle into subrectangles with opposite vertices and for between and and between and . These rectangles all have equal area .    -  Choose a point in each rectangle . Then a double Riemann sum for over is given by        With terms defined as in the Double Riemann Sum, the double integral of over is     Two interpretations of the double integral are:   -  The volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the rectangle minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the rectangle ;    -  Dividing the double integral of over by the area of gives us the average value of the function on . If on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the box with base that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .           Suppose and is the rectangle with vertices (0,0), (6,0), (6,4), (0,4). In each part, estimate using Riemann sums. For underestimates or overestimates, consistently use either the lower left-hand corner or the upper right-hand corner of each rectangle in a subdivision, as appropriate.  (a) Without subdividing ,  Underestimate =  Overestimate =  (b) By partitioning into four equal-sized rectangles.  Underestimate =  Overestimate =                             Consider the solid that lies above the square (in the -plane) , and below the elliptic paraboloid .  Estimate the volume by dividing into 9 equal squares and choosing the sample points to lie in the midpoints of each square.              Let be the rectangle with vertices , , , and and let .  (a) Find reasonable upper and lower bounds for without subdividing .  upper bound =  lower bound =  (b) Estimate three ways: by partitioning into four subrectangles and evaluating at its maximum and minimum values on each subrectangle, and then by considering the average of these (over and under) estimates.  overestimate:   underestimate:   average:                             (a) If we take the partition of consisting of just itself, we get Similarly, we get  (b) The estimates asked for are just the upper and lower sums. We partition into subrectangles of width 1 and height 1, where is the lower-left corner of . The subrectangles are then , , , and . Then we find the lower sum The minimum occurs at the lower-left corner of each rectangle, so Similarly, the upper sum is so The upper sum is an overestimate and the lower sum is an underestimate, so we can get a better estimate by averaging them to get .        Using Riemann sums with four subdivisions in each direction, find upper and lower bounds for the volume under the graph of above the rectangle with .  upper bound =  lower bound =             into subrectangles with the lines , , , , and and the lines , , , , and . Then we have 16 subrectangles, each of which we denote , where is the location of the lower-left corner of the subrectangle. We want to find a lower bound and an upper bound for the volume above each subrectangle. The lower bound for the volume of is because the area of is . The function increases with both and over the whole region . Thus, because the minimum on each subrectangle is at the corner closest to the origin. Similarly, So we have Since and , expanding this sum gives  Similarly, we can compute the upper sum:          Consider the solid that lies above the square (in the xy-plane) ,  and below the elliptic paraboloid .  (A) Estimate the volume by dividing R into 4 equal squares and choosing the sample points to lie in the lower left hand corners.  (B) Estimate the volume by dividing R into 4 equal squares and choosing the sample points to lie in the upper right hand corners..  (C) What is the average of the two answers from (A) and (B)?                        The figure below shows contours of on the region , with and .   Using , find an overestimate and an underestimate for .  Overestimate =  Underestimate =             in each square, assuming that the largest value may be one larger than the largest contour value seen (if the contour doesn't seem to cross a corner of the square), we have and similarly, for an underestimate,         The figure below shows the distribution of temperature, in degrees C, in a 5 meter by 5 meter heated room.   Using Riemann sums, estimate the average temperature in the room.  average temperature =        . We shall begin our sum as an upper estimate starting with the lower left corner of the room and continue across the bottom and moving upward using the highest temperature, , in each case. So the upper Riemann sum becomes  Thus, taking the maximum value for each region (and, where the temperatures are not bounded in the box, taking the largest value plus one), we have  In the same way, the lower Riemann sum is formed by taking the lowest temperature (and, where the temperatures are not bounded in the box, taking the largest value minus one), , in each case:  Thus, taking the minimum value for each region, we have  So, averaging the upper and lower sums we get: . To compute the average temperature, we divide by the area of the room, That is, approximately C.        Values of are given in the table below. Let be the rectangle . Find a Riemann sum which is a reasonable estimate for with and . Note that the values given in the table correspond to midpoints.

Find the values of Riemann sums which are reasonable over- and under-estimates for with and .  over-estimate:  under-estimate:             Then we can calculate the lower and upper sum by taking the smallest and largest values on each rectangle: so the lower sum is and the upper sum is          The temperature at any point on a metal plate in the plane is given by , where and are measured in inches and in degrees Celsius. Consider the portion of the plate that lies on the rectangular region .   Estimate the value of by using a double Riemann sum with two subintervals in each direction and choosing to be the point that lies in the upper right corner of each subrectangle.    Determine the area of the rectangle .    Estimate the average temperature, , over the region .    Do you think your estimate in (c) is an over- or under-estimate of the true temperature? Why?             The area of the rectangle is .         The temperature function is decreasing in both the and directions, so the value at the upper right corner of each subrectangle is the smallest temperature on that subrectangle. So our approximation is an underestimate.       The partition points in the direction are , , and and the partition points in the direction are , , and . Using the points that lie in the upper right corner of each subrectangle we have .    The area of the rectangle is .    Using the result of part (a) we approximate the average temperature over as .    The temperature function is decreasing in both the and directions, so the value at the upper right corner of each subrectangle is the smallest temperature on that subrectangle. So our approximation is an underestimate.      Let be a function of independent variables and that is increasing in both the positive and directions on a rectangular domain . For each of the following situations, determine if the double Riemann sum of over is an overestimate or underestimate of the double integral , or if it impossible to determine definitively. Provide justification for your responses.   The double Riemann sum of over where is evaluated at the lower left point of each subrectangle.    The double Riemann sum of over where is evaluated at the upper right point of each subrectangle.    The double Riemann sum of over where is evaluated at the midpoint of each subrectangle.    The double Riemann sum of over where is evaluated at the lower right point of each subrectangle.        underestimate    overestimate    impossible to determine    impossible to determine       The function is increasing in both the and directions, so the value at the lower left corner of each subrectangle is the smallest function value on that subrectangle. Thus the double Riemann sum of over is an underestimate of the double integral.    The function is increasing in both the and directions, so the value at the upper right corner of each subrectangle is the largest function value on that subrectangle. Thus the double Riemann sum of over is an overestimate of the double integral.    While the function is increasing in both the and directions, we do not know exactly how it grows. Thus we cannot determine how the value at the midpoint of each subrectangle compares to other function values on that subrectangle. We cannot determine definitively whether the Riemann sum is an overestimate or an underestimate of the double integral.    While the function is increasing in both the and directions, we do not know exactly how it grows. Thus we cannot determine how the value at the midpoint of each subrectangle compares to other function values on that subrectangle. (For two specific examples, consider and .) It is impossible to determine definitively whether the Riemann sum is an overestimate or an underestimate of the double integral.      The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how cold it feels outside when the wind is blowing. In Table , the wind chill , measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed , measured in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature , also measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Approximate the average wind chill on the rectangle using 3 subintervals in the direction, 4 subintervals in the direction, and the point in the lower left corner in each subrectangle.   Wind chill as a function of wind speed and temperature.

  "body": "  In this activity we introduce the concept of a double Riemann sum.    Review the concept of the Riemann sum from single-variable calculus. Then, explain how we define the definite integral of a continuous function of a single variable on an interval . Include a sketch of a continuous function on an interval with appropriate labeling in order to illustrate your definition.    In our upcoming study of integral calculus for multivariable functions, we will first extend the idea of the single-variable definite integral to functions of two variables over rectangular domains. To do so, we will need to understand how to partition a rectangle into subrectangles. Let be rectangular domain (we can also represent this domain with the notation ), as pictured in Figure .  Rectangular domain with subrectangles.     To form a partition of the full rectangular region, , we will partition both intervals and ; in particular, we choose to partition the interval into three uniformly sized subintervals and the interval into two evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure . In the following questions, we discuss how to identify the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.    Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning.

What is area of each subrectangle?          We approximated the area under the graph of a positive function on an interval by adding areas of rectangles. The process was to subdivide the interval into smaller subintervals, construct rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on that subinterval, then use the sum of the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. In more detail, we started with a continuous function on a closed interval . We then partitioned the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . We chose a point in each subinterval and constructed a rectangle with base the interval and height . The area of the rectangle is .

It is impossible to determine definitively whether the Riemann sum is an overestimate or an underestimate of the double integral.    "

  "body": " Iterated Integrals     How do we evaluate a double integral over a rectangle as an iterated integral, and why does this process work?      Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function over a rectangle as where the different variables and notation are as described in Section . Thus is a limit of double Riemann sums, but while this definition tells us exactly what a double integral is, it is not very helpful for determining the value of a double integral. Fortunately, there is a way to view a double integral as an iterated integral iterated integral rectangular coordinates , which will make computations feasible in many cases.  The viewpoint of an iterated integral is closely connected to an important idea from single-variable calculus. When we studied solids of revolution, such as the one shown in Figure , we saw that in some circumstances we could slice the solid perpendicular to an axis and have each slice be approximately a circular disk. From there, we were able to find the volume of each disk, and then use an integral to add the volumes of the slices. In what follows, we are able to use single integrals to generalize this approach to handle even more general geometric shapes.   A solid of revolution.      Let on the rectangular domain .  As with partial derivatives, we may treat one of the variables in as constant and think of the resulting function as a function of a single variable. Now we investigate what happens if we integrate instead of differentiate.   Choose a fixed value of in the interior of . Let What is the geometric meaning of the value of relative to the surface defined by .

Right: A cross section with fixed and .          For a fixed value of , say , what is the geometric meaning of ? (Hint: Consider how is related to the image at right in Figure .)    Since is continuous on , we can define the function at every value of in . Now think about subdividing the -interval into subintervals, and choosing a value in each of those subintervals. What will be the meaning of the sum ?    Explain why will determine the exact value of the volume under the surface over the rectangle .         Since on the given domain, the value of tells us the area under the -trace curve for that fixed value of .    Since is an area under the -trace for the value , when we multiply that area by a constant width , we obtain the volume of a slab obtained by thickening the region under the trace by a uniform thickness .    This sum will give us the sum of volumes of slabs with constant cross sections parallel to the -plane, where the cross sections look like the areas under the graphs of the traces.    As we let go to infinity, the thickness of the slabs goes to 0 and we are just adding up all of the cross sectional areas of the surface parallel to the -plane, and so gives us the volume of the solid under the surface over the rectangle .        Since on the given domain, the value of tells us the area under the -trace curve for that fixed value of .    Since is an area under the -trace for the value , when we multiply that area by a constant width , we obtain the volume of a slab obtained by thickening the region under the trace by a uniform thickness .    This sum will give us the sum of volumes of slabs with constant cross sections parallel to the -plane, where the cross sections look like the areas under the graphs of the traces.    As we let go to infinity, the thickness of the slabs goes to 0 and we are just adding up all of the cross sectional areas of the surface parallel to the -plane, and so gives us the volume of the solid under the surface over the rectangle .        Iterated Integrals  The ideas that we explored in Preview Activity work more generally and lead to the idea of an iterated integral. Let be a continuous function on a rectangular domain , and let   The function determines the value of the cross sectional area (by area we mean signed area) in the direction for the fixed value of of the solid bounded between the surface defined by and the -plane.   Summing volumes of cross section slices.        The value of this cross sectional area is determined by the input in . Since is a function of , it follows that we can integrate with respect to . In doing so, we use a partition of and make an approximation to the integral given by where is any number in the subinterval . Each term in the sum represents an approximation of a fixed cross sectional slice of the surface in the direction with a fixed width of as illustrated in Figure . We add the signed volumes of these slices as shown in the frames in Figure to obtain an approximation of the total signed volume.  As we let the number of subintervals in the direction approach infinity, we can see that the Riemann sum approaches a limit and that limit is the sum of signed volumes bounded by the function on . Therefore, since is itself determined by an integral, we have   Hence, we can compute the double integral of over by first integrating with respect to on , then integrating the resulting function of with respect to on . The nested integral is called an iterated integral , and we see that each double integral may be represented by two single integrals.  We made a choice to integrate first with respect to . The same argument shows that we can also find the double integral as an iterated integral integrating with respect to first, or   The fact that integrating in either order results in the same value is known as Fubini's Theorem.   Fubini's Theorem  If is a continuous function on a rectangle , then    Fubini's theorem enables us to evaluate iterated integrals without resorting to the limit definition. Instead, working with one integral at a time, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from single-variable calculus to find the exact value of each integral, starting with the inner integral.    Let on the rectangular domain .   Viewing as a fixed constant, use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral Note that you will be integrating with respect to , and holding constant. Your result should be a function of only.    Next, use your result from (a) along with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to determine the value of .    What is the value of ?

Summary    We can evaluate the double integral over a rectangle as an iterated integral in one of two ways:   -   , or    -   .   This process works because each inner integral represents a cross-sectional (signed) area and the outer integral then sums all of the cross-sectional (signed) areas. Fubini's Theorem guarantees that the resulting value is the same, regardless of the order in which we integrate.

  "body": " Double Integrals over General Regions     How do we define a double integral over a non-rectangular region?    What general form does an iterated integral over a non-rectangular region have?      Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function over a rectangle as where the notation is as described in Section . Furthermore, we have seen that we can evaluate a double integral over as an iterated integral of either of the forms   It is natural to wonder how we might define and evaluate a double integral over a non-rectangular region; we explore one such example in the following preview activity.    A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional figure with four faces, each of which is a triangle. A picture of the tetrahedron with vertices , , , and is shown at left in Figure . If we place one vertex at the origin and let vectors , , and be determined by the edges of the tetrahedron that have one end at the origin, then a formula that tells us the volume of the tetrahedron is    Left: The tetrahedron . Right: Projecting onto the -plane.         Use the formula to find the volume of the tetrahedron .    Instead of memorizing or looking up the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, we can use a double integral to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron . To see how, notice that the top face of the tetrahedron is the plane whose equation is Provided that we can use an iterated integral on a non-rectangular region, the volume of the tetrahedron will be given by an iterated integral of the form The issue that is new here is how we find the limits on the integrals; note that the outer integral's limits are in , while the inner ones are in , since we have chosen . To see the domain over which we need to integrate, think of standing way above the tetrahedron looking straight down on it, which means we are projecting the entire tetrahedron onto the -plane. The resulting domain is the triangular region shown at right in Figure . Explain why we can represent the triangular region with the inequalities (Hint: Consider the cross sectional slice shown at right in Figure .)    Explain why it makes sense to now write the volume integral in the form     Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the iterated integral and compare to your result from part (a). (As with iterated integrals over rectangular regions, start with the inner integral.)        Let , , , and . With these points as the vertices of the tetrahedron we have . Using the formula we obtain .    If we take a cross section of the domain for a fixed value of as shown in Figure , we can see that the values on the cross section all have a lowest value of 0, but their highest values lie on the line . We can construct these cross sections for any value of between 0 and 1, so this triangular region is described by the inequalities and .    When we slice vertically, each slice runs from the -axis to the line . So the limits on are . The triangular region has values that run from to , so the limits on the integral as as shown.    Using basic integration techniques we have . This is the same result we obtained from the formula in part (a).        Let , , , and . With these points as the vertices of the tetrahedron we have .

Using basic integration techniques we have . This is the same result we obtained from the formula in part (a).        Double Integrals over General Regions  So far, we have learned that a double integral over a rectangular region may be interpreted in one of two ways:    tells us the volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the rectangle minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the rectangle ;     , where is the area of tells us the average value of the function on . If on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the box with base that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .     As we saw in Preview Activity , a function may be considered over regions other than rectangular ones, and thus we want to understand how to set up and evaluate double integrals over non-rectangular regions. Note that if we can, then the two interpretations of the double integral noted above will naturally extend to solid regions with non-rectangular bases.  So, suppose is a continuous function on a closed, bounded domain . For example, consider as the circular domain shown at left in Figure .   Left: A non-rectangular domain. Right: Enclosing this domain in a rectangle.       We can enclose in a rectangular domain as shown at right in Figure and extend the function to be defined over in order to be able to use the definition of the double integral over a rectangle. We extend in such a way that its values at the points in that are not in contribute 0 to the value of the integral. In other words, define a function on as   We then say that the double integral of over double integral over a general region is the same as the double integral of over , and thus   In practice, we just ignore everything that is in but not in , since these regions contribute 0 to the value of the integral.  Just as with double integrals over rectangles, a double integral over a domain can be evaluated as an iterated integral. If the region can be described by the inequalities and , where and are functions of only , then   Alternatively, if the region is described by the inequalities and , where and are functions of only , we have   The structure of an iterated integral is of particular note:  In an iterated double integral:   the limits on the outer integral must be constants;    the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable that is, if the inner integral is with respect to , then its limits may only involve and constants, and vice versa.     We next consider a detailed example.    Let be defined on the triangle with vertices , , and as shown at left in Figure .   A triangular domain and slices in the and directions.        To evaluate , we must first describe the region in terms of the variables and . We take two approaches.   Approach 1: Integrate first with respect to .  In this case we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form and therefore we need to describe in terms of inequalities Since we are integrating with respect to first, the iterated integral has the form where is a cross sectional area in the direction. So we are slicing the domain perpendicular to the -axis and want to understand what a cross sectional area of the overall solid will look like. Several slices of the domain are shown in the middle image in Figure . On a slice with fixed value, the values are bounded below by 0 and above by the coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Thus, ; to find , we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of . The hypotenuse connects the points (0,0) and (2,3) and hence has equation . This gives the upper bound on as . The leftmost vertical cross section is at and the rightmost one is at , so we have and . Therefore, We evaluate the iterated integral by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus first to the inner integral, and then to the outer one, and find that     Approach 2: Integrate first with respect to .  In this case, we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form and thus need to describe in terms of inequalities Since we are integrating with respect to first, the iterated integral has the form where is a cross sectional area of the solid in the direction. Several slices of the domain perpendicular to the -axis are shown at right in Figure . On a slice with fixed value, the values are bounded below by the coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle and above by 2. So ; to find , we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of . Solving the earlier equation we have for the hypotenuse ( ) for gives us . This makes . The lowest horizontal cross section is at and the uppermost one is at , so we have and . Therefore, We evaluate the resulting iterated integral as before by twice applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and find that      We see, of course, that in the situation where can be described in two different ways, the order in which we choose to set up and evaluate the double integral doesn't matter, and the same value results in either case.    The meaning of a double integral over a non-rectangular region, , parallels the meaning over a rectangular region. In particular,    tells us the volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the closed, bounded region minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the region ;     , where is the area of tells us the average value of the function on . If on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the solid with base and constant cross-sectional area that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .       Consider the double integral , where is the triangular region with vertices (0,0), (4,0), and (0,2).   Write the given integral as an iterated integral of the form . Draw a labeled picture of with relevant cross sections.    Write the given integral as an iterated integral of the form . Draw a labeled picture of with relevant cross sections.    Evaluate the two iterated integrals from (a) and (b), and verify that they produce the same value. Give at least one interpretation of the meaning of your result.                     Evaluating the iterated integral with respect to then gives us . Evaluating the iterated integral with respect to then gives us . Since is non-negative on the domain , these two iterated integrals tell us the volume of the solid bounded above by the graph of and below by the triangular region .        Integrating with respect to first means we take cross sections of parallel to the -axis. As the figure below illustrates, the lower end of any cross section is always on the -axis (with ) and the upper limit is on the line joining and . The limits on need to written in terms of , so the upper limit is . These cross sections run from to , so as an iterated integral we have .

Consider the iterated integral .   Sketch the region of integration, , for which     Determine the equivalent iterated integral that results from integrating in the opposite order ( , instead of ). That is, determine the limits of integration for which     Evaluate one of the two iterated integrals above. Explain what the value you obtained tells you.    Set up and evaluate a single definite integral to determine the exact area of , .    Determine the exact average value of over .         The region of integration has and . This region is as shown in the figure below.          Evaluating the original integral yields . Since on this domain, the value obtained tells us the volume of the solid bounded above by the graph of the plane and below by the region of integration.    The area of is found by integrating 1 over the domain , or .             The region of integration has and . This region is as shown in the figure below.     If we integrate with respect to first, then , the cross sections in the -direction will always have their right endpoints on the line . However, the left endpoints change as shown in the figure above. At the bottom of the figure, runs from to for between and . In the middle, runs between and for between and . At the top, runs from to for between and . So a sum of iterated integrals that gives the same value as the given iterated integral is .    Evaluating the original integral yields . Since on this domain, the value obtained tells us the volume of the solid bounded above by the graph of the plane and below by the region of integration.    The area of is found by integrating 1 over the domain , or .    The average value of on is .        Consider the iterated integral .   Explain why we cannot find a simple antiderivative for with respect to , and thus are unable to evaluate in the indicated order using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.    Given that , sketch the region of integration, .    Rewrite the given iterated integral in the opposite order, using . (Hint: You may need more than one integral.)    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the iterated integral you developed in (c). Write one sentence to explain the meaning of the value you found.    What is the important lesson this activity offers regarding the order in which we set up an iterated integral?         No substitution will work to integrate because of the square in the exponent. Using parts only makes the integral more complicated, and we have no other techniques to apply to this integrand.    The domain of integration is shown below.          Evaluating the iterated integral yields . Since on , this integral tells us the volume of the solid bounded above by the surface and below by the region .    We need to be flexible when setting up iterated integrals sometimes one order of integration is very difficult (or impossible) while the other order is easier. So it is important to practice changing the order of integration in iterated integrals.        No substitution will work to integrate because of the square in the exponent. Using parts only makes the integral more complicated, and we have no other techniques to apply to this integrand.    The domain of integration is shown below.

We need to be flexible when setting up iterated integrals sometimes one order of integration is very difficult (or impossible) while the other order is easier. So it is important to practice changing the order of integration in iterated integrals.        Summary    For a double integral over a non-rectangular region , we enclose in a rectangle and then extend integrand to a function so that at all points in outside of and for all points in . We then define to be equal to .    In an iterated double integral, the limits on the outer integral must be constants while the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable. In other words, an iterated double integral has one of the following forms (which result in the same value): where and are functions of only and the region is described by the inequalities and or where and are functions of only and the region is described by the inequalities and .

Similarly, for , we have that the contours are the circles , all of which are centered on . (b) The cross-section has equation . If , the base region in the -plane extends from to . Thus the area is  (c) Using this idea and slicing parallel to the -axis, we get         Set up a double integral in rectangular coordinates for calculating the volume of the solid under the graph of the function and above the plane .

  "body": " Applications of Double Integrals     If we have a mass density function for a lamina (thin plate), how does a double integral determine the mass of the lamina?    How may a double integral be used to find the area between two curves?    Given a mass density function on a lamina, how can we find the lamina's center of mass?    What is a joint probability density function? How do we determine the probability of an event if we know a probability density function?      So far, we have interpreted the double integral of a function over a domain in two different ways. First, tells us a difference of volumes the volume the surface defined by bounds above the -plane on minus the volume the surface bounds below the -plane on . In addition, determines the average value of on . In this section, we investigate several other applications of double integrals, using the integration process as seen in Preview Activity : we partition into small regions, approximate the desired quantity on each small region, then use the integral to sum these values exactly in the limit.  The following preview activity explores how a double integral can be used to determine the density of a thin plate with a mass density distribution. Recall that in single-variable calculus, we considered a similar problem and computed the mass of a one-dimensional rod with a mass-density distribution. There, as here, the key idea is that if density is constant, mass is the product of density and volume.    Suppose that we have a flat, thin object (called a lamina ) whose density varies across the object. We can think of the density on a lamina as a measure of mass per unit area. As an example, consider a circular plate of radius 1 cm centered at the origin whose density varies depending on the distance from its center so that the density in grams per square centimeter at point is    Suppose that we partition the plate into subrectangles , where and , of equal area , and select a point in for each and . What is the meaning of the quantity ?    State a double Riemann sum that provides an approximation of the mass of the plate.    Explain why the double integral tells us the exact mass of the plate.    Determine an iterated integral which, if evaluated, would give the exact mass of the plate. Do not actually evaluate the integral. (This integral is considerably easier to evaluate in polar coordinates, which we will learn more about in Section .)         If we assume the density is the constant on , then the quantity is a density times area and approximates the mass of the chunk of the plate over .         If we take the limit of the sum in part (b) as the number of subrectangles goes to infinity, we are adding masses over smaller and smaller subrectangles, so in the limit , the double integral gives the total mass of the plate.             If we assume the density is the constant on , then the quantity is a density times area and approximates the mass of the chunk of the plate over .    To approximate the mass of the plate, we add the approximations on each subrectangle to obtain , which approximates the total mass of the plate.    If we take the limit of the sum in part (b) as the number of subrectangles goes to infinity, we are adding masses over smaller and smaller subrectangles, so in the limit , the double integral gives the total mass of the plate.    The mass of our plate in this example is .        Mass  Density is a measure of some quantity per unit area or volume. For example, we can measure the human population density of some region as the number of humans in that region divided by the area of that region. In physics, the mass density of an object is the mass of the object per unit area or volume. As suggested by Preview Activity , the following holds in general.   The mass of a lamina  If describes the density of a lamina defined by a planar region , then the mass double integral mass of lamina of is given by the double integral .     Let be a half-disk lamina of radius 3 in quadrants IV and I, centered at the origin as shown in Figure . Assume the density at point is given by . Find the exact mass of the lamina.   A half disk lamina.           We integrate the density over the region . We have , and the region can be described by for between and . Thus, the mass of the lamina is .      Area  If we consider the situation where the mass-density distribution is constant, we can also see how a double integral may be used to determine the area of a region. Assuming that over a closed bounded region , where the units of are mass per unit of area, it follows that is the mass of the lamina. But since the density is constant, the numerical value of the integral is simply the area.  As the following activity demonstrates, we can also see this fact by considering a three-dimensional solid whose height is always 1.    Suppose we want to find the area of the bounded region between the curves   A picture of this region is shown in Figure .   The volume of a solid with constant height is given by the area of the base times the height. Hence, we may interpret the area of the region as the volume of a solid with base and of uniform height 1. That is, the area of is given by . Write an iterated integral whose value is . (Hint: Which order of integration might be more efficient? Why?)  The graphs of and .       Evaluate the iterated integral from (a). What does the result tell you?              The value of the iterated integral is the area of : square units.        The double integral gives the volume of the solid of uniform height 1 and base area equal to the area of , so this integral also gives the area of . To set up this integral, we need to describe the region . If we integrate with respect to , then the graph of forms the top of and the graph of forms the bottom. To find the limits on , we need to determine the points of intersections of the two curves. Now and intersect when or when and . Therefore, the area of is given by the iterated integral .    Evaluating the iterated integral gives us . Thus the area of is square units.      We now formally state the conclusion from our earlier discussion and Activity .   The double integral and area  Given a closed, bounded region in the plane, the area of , denoted , is given by the double integral      Center of Mass  The center of mass of an object is a point at which the object will balance perfectly. For example, the center of mass of a circular disk of uniform density is located at its center. For any object, if we throw it through the air, it will spin around its center of mass and behave as if all the mass is located at the center of mass.  In order to understand the role that integrals play in determining the center of mass of an object with a nonuniform mass distribution, we start by finding the center of mass of a collection of distinct point-masses in the plane.  Let , , , be masses located in the plane. Think of these masses as connected by rigid rods of negligible weight from some central point . A picture with four masses is shown in Figure . Now imagine balancing this system by placing it on a thin pole at the point perpendicular to the plane containing the masses. Unless the masses are perfectly balanced, the system will fall off the pole. The point at which the system will balance perfectly is called the center of mass of the system. Our goal is to determine the center of mass of a system of discrete masses, then extend this to a continuous lamina.   A center of mass of four masses.    Each mass exerts a force (called a moment ) around the lines and that causes the system to tilt in the direction of the mass. These moments are dependent on the mass and the distance from the given line. Let be the location of mass , the location of mass , etc. In order to balance perfectly, the moments in the direction and in the direction must be in equilibrium. We determine these moments and solve the resulting system to find the equilibrium point at the center of mass.  The force that mass exerts to tilt the system from the line is where is the gravitational constant. Similarly, the force mass exerts to tilt the system from the line is   In general, the force that mass exerts to tilt the system from the line is   For the system to balance, we need the forces to sum to 0, so that   Solving for , we find that   A similar argument shows that   The value is called the total moment with respect to the -axis; is the total moment with respect to the -axis. Hence, the respective quotients of the moments to the total mass, , determines the center of mass of a point-mass system:   Now, suppose that rather than a point-mass system, we have a continuous lamina with a variable mass-density . We may estimate its center of mass by partitioning the lamina into subrectangles of equal area , and treating the resulting partitioned lamina as a point-mass system. In particular, we select a point in the th subrectangle, and observe that the quanity is density times area, so approximates the mass of the small portion of the lamina determined by the subrectangle .  We now treat as a point mass at the point . The coordinates of the center of mass of these point masses are thus given by   If we take the limit as and go to infinity, we obtain the exact center of mass of the continuous lamina.   The center of mass of a lamina  The coordinates of the center of mass of a lamina center of mass of a lamina  with density are given by    The center of mass of a lamina can then be thought of as a weighted average of all of the points in the lamina with the weights given by the density at each point. The centroid centroid of a lamina of a lamina is the just the average of all of the points in the lamina, or the center of mass if the density at each point is 1.  The numerators of and are called the respective moments moments about coordinate axes of the lamina about the coordinate axes. Thus, the moment of a lamina with density about the -axis is and the moment of about the -axis is   If is the mass of the lamina, it follows that the center of mass is .    In this activity we determine integrals that represent the center of mass of a lamina described by the triangular region bounded by the -axis and the lines and in the first quadrant if the density at point is . A picture of the lamina is shown in Figure .   The lamina bounded by the -axis and the lines and in the first quadrant.      Set up an iterated integral that represents the mass of the lamina.    Assume the mass of the lamina is 14. Set up two iterated integrals that represent the coordinates of the center of mass of the lamina.              coordinate: . coordinate: .        The mass of the lamina is given by . To calculate this mass, we set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to then : .    The coordinate of the center of mass is given by . An iterated integral that gives us this coordinate is . The coordinate of the center of mass is given by . An iterated integral that gives us this coordinate is .        Probability  Calculating probabilities is a very important application of integration in the physical, social, and life sciences. To understand the basics, consider the game of darts in which a player throws a dart at a board and tries to hit a particular target. Let us suppose that a dart board is in the form of a disk with radius 10 inches. If we assume that a player throws a dart at random, and is not aiming at any particular point, then it is equally probable that the dart will strike any single point on the board. For instance, the probability that the dart will strike a particular 1 square inch region is , or the ratio of the area of the desired target to the total area of (assuming that the dart thrower always hits the board itself at some point). Similarly, the probability that the dart strikes a point in the disk of radius 3 inches is given by the area of divided by the area of . In other words, the probability that the dart strikes the disk is   The integrand, , may be thought of as a distribution function , describing how the dart strikes are distributed across the board. In this case the distribution function is constant since we are assuming a uniform distribution, but we can easily envision situations where the distribution function varies. For example, if the player is fairly good and is aiming for the bulls eye (the center of ), then the distribution function could be skewed toward the center, say for some constant positive . If we assume that the player is consistent enough so that the dart always strikes the board, then the probability that the dart strikes the board somewhere is 1, and the distribution function will have to satisfy This makes , which you can check.    For such a function , the probability that the dart strikes in the disk of radius 1 would be   Indeed, the probability that the dart strikes in any region that lies within is given by   The preceding discussion highlights the general idea behind calculating probabilities. We assume we have a joint probability density function joint probability density function  , a function of two independent variables and defined on a domain that satisfies the conditions    for all and in ,    the probability that is between some values and while is between some values and is given by     The probability double integral probability that the point is in is 1, that is      Note that it is possible that could be an infinite region and the limits on the integral in Equation could be infinite. When we have such a probability density function , the probability that the point is in some region contained in the domain (the notation we use here is ) is determined by     A firm manufactures smoke detectors. Two components for the detectors come from different suppliers one in Michigan and one in Ohio. The company studies these components for their reliability and their data suggests that if is the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component from the Michigan supplier and the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component from the Ohio supplier, then the joint probability density function might be given by    Theoretically, the components might last forever, so the domain of the function is the set of all such that and . To show that is a probability density function on we need to demonstrate that or that Use your knowledge of improper integrals to verify that is indeed a probability density function.    Assume that the smoke detector fails only if both of the supplied components fail. To determine the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within one year, we will need to determine the probability that the life span of each component is between 0 and 1 years. Set up an appropriate iterated integral, and evaluate the integral to determine the probability.    What is the probability that a randomly chosen smoke detector will fail between years 3 and 7?    Suppose that the manufacturer determines that one of the components is more likely to fail than the other, and hence conjectures that the probability density function is instead What is the value of ?         We evaluate the double integral to determine if is a probability density function: . So is a probability density function.     So the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within one year is approximately 40%.    approximately 0.24%             We evaluate the double integral to determine if is a probability density function: . So is a probability density function.    We need both components to have a life span of 1 year or less, so the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within one year is . So the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within one year is approximately 40%.    We need both components to have a life span of between 3 and 7 years, so the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within 3 to 7 years is . This amounts to approximately 0.24%.    To find we need to determine when . We evaluate the iterated integral to determine the value of : . So we need to have for to be a probability density function.

  "body": " Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates     What are the polar coordinates of a point in two-space?    How do we convert between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates?    What is the area element in polar coordinates?    How do we convert a double integral in rectangular coordinates to a double integral in polar coordinates?      While we have naturally defined double integrals in the rectangular coordinate system, starting with domains that are rectangular regions, there are many of these integrals that are difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate. For example, consider the domain that is the unit circle and . To integrate over , we would use the iterated integral   For this particular integral, regardless of the order of integration, we are unable to find an antiderivative of the integrand; in addition, even if we were able to find an antiderivative, the inner limits of integration involve relatively complicated functions.  It is useful, therefore, to be able to translate to other coordinate systems where the limits of integration and evaluation of the involved integrals is simpler. In this section we provide a quick discussion of one such system polar coordinates and then introduce and investigate their ramifications for double integrals. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to consider domains and graphs relative to a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternate coordinate system that allows us to consider domains less suited to rectangular coordinates, such as circles.    The coordinates of a point determine its location. In particular, the rectangular coordinates of a point are given by an ordered pair , where is the (signed) distance the point lies from the -axis to and is the (signed) distance the point lies from the -axis to . In polar coordinates, we locate the point by considering the distance the point lies from the origin, , and the angle the line segment from the origin to forms with the positive -axis.    Determine the rectangular coordinates of the following points:    The point that lies 1 unit from the origin on the positive -axis.    The point that lies 2 units from the origin and such that makes an angle of with the positive -axis.    The point that lies 3 units from the origin such that makes an angle of with the positive -axis.      Part (a) indicates that the two pieces of information completely determine the location of a point: either the traditional coordinates, or alternately, the distance from the point to the origin along with the angle that the line through the origin and the point makes with the positive -axis. We write to denote the point's location in its polar coordinate representation. Find polar coordinates for the points with the given rectangular coordinates.    ii. iii.        For each of the following points whose coordinates are given in polar form, determine the rectangular coordinates of the point.    ii. iii.            We get the following points:                     We get the following polar coordinates:                     The rectangular coordinates are:                         Determine the rectangular coordinates of the following points:   This point has coordinate 0, so the coordinate must be 1 and the point is .    The angle of with the positive -axis places the point on the -axis. The point on the -axis a distance 2 from the origin is the point .    Draw a right triangle from the origin to to the point on the -axis below . The acute angle at the origin has measure . So and . So this point has rectangular coordinates .       Part (a) indicates that the two pieces of information completely determine the location of a point: either the traditional coordinates, or alternately, the distance from the point to the origin along with the angle that the line through the origin and the point makes with the positive -axis. We write to denote the point's location in its polar coordinate representation. Find polar coordinates for the points with the given rectangular coordinates.   The distance from the point with rectangular coordinates to the origin is 1, and the angle the line through the origin and this point makes with the positive -axis is , so the polar coordinate representation of this point is .    The distance from the point with rectangular coordinates to the origin is 2, and the angle the line through the origin and this point makes with the positive -axis is , so the polar coordinate representation of this point is .    The distance from the point with rectangular coordinates to the origin is , and the angle the line through the origin and this point makes with the positive -axis is , so the polar coordinate representation of this point is .       For each of the following points whose coordinates are given in polar form, determine the rectangular coordinates of the point.   The rectangular coordinates are and .    The rectangular coordinates are and .    The rectangular coordinates are and .           Polar Coordinates  The rectangular coordinate system is best suited for graphs and regions that are naturally considered over a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternative that offers good options for functions and domains that have more circular characteristics. A point in rectangular coordinates that is described by an ordered pair , where is the displacement from to the -axis and is the displacement from to the -axis, as seen in Preview Activity , can also be described with polar coordinates polar coordinates  , where is the distance from to the origin and is the angle formed by the line segment and the positive -axis, as shown at left in Figure .   The polar coordinates of a point and the polar coordinate grid.       Trigonometry and the Pythagorean Theorem allow for straightforward conversion from rectangular to polar, and vice versa.   Converting between rectangular and polar coordinates     Converting from rectangular to polar.  If we are given the rectangular coordinates of a point , then the polar coordinates of satisfy     Converting from polar to rectangular.  If we are given the polar coordinates of a point , then the rectangular coordinates of satisfy        Note: The angle in the polar coordinates of a point is not unique. We could replace with and still be at the same terminal point. In addition, the sign of does not uniquely determine the quadrant in which lies, so we have to determine the value of from the location of the point. In other words, more care has to be paid when using polar coordinates than rectangular coordinates.  We can draw graphs of curves in polar coordinates in a similar way to how we do in rectangular coordinates. However, when plotting in polar coordinates, we use a grid that considers changes in angles and changes in distance from the origin. In particular, the angles and distances partition the plane into small wedges as shown at right in Figure .    Most polar graphing devices can plot curves in polar coordinates of the form . Use such a device to complete this activity.   Before plotting the polar curve (where can have any value), think about what shape it should have, in light of how is connected to and . Then use appropriate technology to draw the graph and test your intuition.    The equation does not define as a function of , so we can't graph this equation on many polar plotters. What do you think the graph of the polar curve looks like? Why?    Before plotting the polar curve , what do you think the graph looks like? Why? Use technology to plot the curve and compare your intuition.    What does the region defined by (where can have any value) look like? (Hint: Compare to your response from part (a).)    What does the region defined by and look like?    Consider the curve . For some values of we will have . In these situations, we plot the point as (in other words, when , we reflect the point through the origin). With that in mind, what do you think the graph of looks like? Plot this curve using technology and compare to your intuition.         Since represents a distance from the origin, any curve with a constant value of should be a circle, centered at the origin, with radius .    The set of points with a constant value of all make the same angle with the positive -axis. This set of points should then form a line through the origin making an angle with the positive -axis.    As increases, so does the value of . Thus, as the point rotates around the origin, its distance from the origin also increases in a uniform manner. The set of these points should be a spiral, spiraling away from the origin as it rotates counterclockwise around the origin.    As increases, the values of will oscillate between and . When is negative, we reflect around the origin. So the resulting curve should look like a circle in the first and second quadrants. Note that can also be represented as . So in rectangular coordinates the curve has equation , or . This is a circle centered at with radius .        Since represents a distance from the origin, any curve with a constant value of should be a circle, centered at the origin, with radius .    The set of points with a constant value of all make the same angle with the positive -axis. This set of points should then form a line through the origin making an angle with the positive -axis.    As increases, so does the value of . Thus, as the point rotates around the origin, its distance from the origin also increases in a uniform manner. The set of these points should be a spiral, spiraling away from the origin as it rotates counterclockwise around the origin.    As increases, the values of will oscillate between and . When is negative, we reflect around the origin. So the resulting curve should look like a circle in the first and second quadrants. Note that can also be represented as . So in rectangular coordinates the curve has equation , or . This is a circle centered at with radius .        Integrating in Polar Coordinates  Consider the double integral where is the unit disk. While we cannot directly evaluate this integral in rectangular coordinates, a change to polar coordinates will convert it to one we can easily evaluate.  We have seen how to evaluate a double integral as an iterated integral of the form in rectangular coordinates, because we know that in rectangular coordinates. To make the change to polar coordinates, we not only need to represent the variables and in polar coordinates, but we also must understand how to write the area element, , in polar coordinates. That is, we must determine how the area element can be written in terms of and in the context of polar coordinates. We address this question in the following activity.   Left: A polar rectangle. Right: An annulus.         Consider a polar rectangle , with between and and between and as shown at left in Figure . Let and . Let be the area of this region.    Explain why the area in polar coordinates is not .    Now find by the following steps:    Find the area of the annulus (the washer-like region) between and , as shown at right in Figure . This area will be in terms of and .    Observe that the region is only a portion of the annulus, so the area of is only a fraction of the area of the annulus. For instance, if were , then the resulting wedge would be of the entire annulus. In this more general context, using the wedge between the two noted angles, what fraction of the area of the annulus is the area ?    Write an expression for in terms of , , , and .    Finally, write the area in terms of , , , and , where each quantity appears only once in the expression. (Hint: Think about how to factor a difference of squares.)      As we take the limit as and go to 0, becomes , becomes , and becomes , the area element. Using your work in (iv), write in terms of , , and .        The quantity would be the area of a rectangle with side lengths and . The area of the polar region is the area of a slice of a washer, not a rectangle the sides are not all straight.    Now find by following these steps.                                   The quantity would be the area of a rectangle with side lengths and . The area of the polar region is the area of a slice of a washer, not a rectangle the sides are not all straight.    Now find by following these steps.   The area of the annulus between and is the area of the disk with larger radius minus the area of the disk with smaller radius . So the area of the annulus is .    Our region is the portion of the annulus between and . So the angle that cuts the region from the annulus has measure . Since the central angle of the entire annulus is , the area of the region is the fractional portion of the whole annulus.    The fractional portion of the area of the whole annulus is .    Using a difference of squares gives us .       Taking the limit as and go to 0, both and approach the same value , so .      From the result of Activity , we see when we convert an integral from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we must not only convert and to being in terms of and , but we also have to change the area element to in polar coordinates. As we saw in Activity , the reason the additional factor of in the polar area element is due to the fact that in polar coordinates, the cross sectional area element increases as increases, while the cross sectional area element in rectangular coordinates is constant. So, given a double integral in rectangular coordinates, to write a corresponding iterated integral in polar coordinates, we replace with , with and with . Of course, we need to describe the region in polar coordinates as well. To summarize:   Double integrals in polar coordinates  The double integral in rectangular coordinates can be converted to a double integral in polar coordinates iterated integral polar coordinates as .     Let on the disk . We will evaluate .  In rectangular coordinates the double integral can be written as the iterated integral   We cannot evaluate this iterated integral, because does not have an elementary antiderivative with respect to either or . However, since and the region is circular, it is natural to wonder whether converting to polar coordinates will allow us to evaluate the new integral. To do so, we replace with , with , and with to obtain   The disc is described in polar coordinates by the constraints and . Therefore, it follows that   We can evaluate the resulting iterated polar integral as follows:     While there is no firm rule for when polar coordinates can or should be used, they are a natural alternative anytime the domain of integration may be expressed simply in polar form, and\/or when the integrand involves expressions such as     Let and .   Sketch the region and then write the double integral of over as an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates.    Write the double integral of over as an iterated integral in polar coordinates.    Evaluate one of the iterated integrals. Why is the final value you found not surprising?                   Evaluating the integral yields . The graph of the plane crosses the -plane along the line , and bounds the same amount of volume below the -plane as above on the disk . So we should have expected the value of the integral to be .        The integral can be written as the iterated integral .    To convert to polar coordinates, we replace with , with and with to obtain . The disc is described in polar coordinates by the constraints and . So we have .    We evaluate the integral in polar coordinates as follows: . The graph of the plane crosses the -plane along the line , and bounds the same amount of volume below the -plane as above on the disk . So we should have expected the value of the integral to be .        Consider the circle given by as shown in Figure .  The graphs of and , for use in Activity .      Determine a polar curve in the form that traces out the circle . (Hint: Recall that a circle centered at the origin of radius can be described by the equations and .)    Find the exact average value of over the interior of the circle .    Find the volume under the surface over the region , where is the region bounded above by the line and below by the circle (this is the shaded region in Figure ).    Explain why in both (b) and (c) it is advantageous to use polar coordinates.         The circle can be described as with .              In (b), it is very difficult to integrate in rectangular coordinates, and in (c) the region is much more easily described in polar coordinates.        When expanded, the equation of the circle is . We can write this in polar coordinates as , or . Thus, the circle can be described as with .    The circle has radius 1, so . Note that can be written in polar form as . Thus, the average value of over is .    In polar coordinates, the line is represented as , or , or . Therefore, the region is described by with . So the under the surface over the region is given by .    In (b), it is very difficult to integrate in rectangular coordinates, and in (c) the region is much more easily described in polar coordinates.        Summary    The polar representation of a point is the ordered pair where is the distance from the origin to and is the angle the ray through the origin and makes with the positive -axis.

  "title": "Surfaces Defined Parametrically and Surface Area",
  "body": " Surfaces Defined Parametrically and Surface Area     What is a parameterization of a surface?    How do we find the surface area of a parametrically defined surface?      We have now studied at length how curves in space can be defined parametrically by functions of the form , and surfaces can be represented by functions . In what follows, we will see how we can also define surfaces parametrically. A one-dimensional curve in space results from a vector function that relies upon one parameter, so a two-dimensional surface naturally involves the use of two parameters. If , , and are functions of independent parameters and , then the terminal points of all vectors of the form form a surface in space. The equations , , and are the parametric equations parameterization surface for the surface, or a parametrization of the surface. In Preview Activity we investigate how to parameterize a cylinder and a cone.    Recall the standard parameterization of the unit circle that is given by where .   Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in that has its center at and lies in the plane .    Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at and lies in the plane .    Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at and lies in the plane .    Taking into account your responses in (a), (b), and (c), describe the graph that results from the set of parametric equations where and . Explain your thinking.    Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a stack of circles of constant radius, a cone can be viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius. Modify the parametrizations of the circles above in order to construct the parameterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin, whose base radius is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane . Use appropriate technology to plot the parametric equations you develop. (Hint: The cross sections parallel to the -plane are circles, with the radii varying linearly as increases.)         A parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in that has its center at and lies in the plane is .    A parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at and lies in the plane is .    A parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at and lies in the plane . .    This set of parametric equations would describe a cylinder centered around the -axis, with a radius of , that extended from to . The parameter in allows the value to vary independently of the parameter , which traces out the circles at each cross-sectional level of the cylinder.    If we set the vertex of the cone at the origin and orient the cone to open upwards, then the cross sections parallel to the plane are again circles, with the radii varying linearly as varies. So the parameterization defined by for will gives us a cone. If we want a cone with base radius 4 and height 3, we can modify the equations a bit. We need the radii to increase linearly so that when is 3 the radius of the cross section parallel to the plane is 4. That means we need the radii to be as increases from 0 to 3. So a parameterization that will gives us this cone is defined by for from 0 to 3.        Parametric Surfaces  In a single-variable setting, any function may have its graph expressed parametrically. For instance, given , by considering the parameterization (where belongs to the domain of ), we generate the same curve. What is more important is that certain curves that are not functions may be represented parametrically; for instance, the circle (which cannot be represented by a single function) can be parameterized by , where .  In the same way, in a two-variable setting, the surface may be expressed parametrically by considering where varies over the entire domain of . Therefore, any familiar surface that we have studied so far can be generated as a parametric surface. But what is more powerful is that there are surfaces that cannot be generated by a single function (such as the unit sphere), but that can be represented parametrically. We now consider an important example.    Consider the torus (or doughnut) shown in Figure .   A torus.    To find a parametrization of this torus, we recall our work in Preview Activity . There, we saw that a circle of radius that has its center at the point and is contained in the horizontal plane , as shown in Figure , can be parametrized using the vector-valued function defined by where .   A circle in a horizontal plane centered at .    To obtain the torus in Figure , we begin with a circle of radius in the -plane centered at , as shown on the left of Figure . We may parametrize the points on this circle, using the parameter , by using the equations where .   Revolving a circle to obtain a torus.       Let's focus our attention on one point on this circle, such as the indicated point, which has coordinates for a fixed value of the parameter . When this point is revolved about the -axis, we obtain a circle contained in a horizontal plane centered at and having radius , as shown on the right of Figure . If we let be the new parameter that generates the circle for the rotation about the -axis, this circle may be parametrized by   Now using our earlier parametric equations for and for the original smaller circle, we have an overall parameterization of the torus given by   To trace out the entire torus, we require that the parameters vary through the values and .      In this activity, we seek a parametrization of the sphere of radius centered at the origin, as shown on the left in Figure . Notice that this sphere may be obtained by revolving a half-circle contained in the -plane about the -axis, as shown on the right.   A sphere obtained by revolving a half-circle.         Begin by writing a parametrization of this half-circle using the parameter : Be sure to state the domain of the parameter .    By revolving the points on this half-circle about the -axis, obtain a parametrization of the points on the sphere of radius . Be sure to include the domain of both parameters and . (Hint: What is the radius of the circle obtained when revolving a point on the half-circle around the axis?)    Draw the surface defined by your parameterization with appropriate technology.        The parameterization of the half-circle is , , for .    A parameterization of the curve obtained by revolving the point around the -axis is , , for , where is the distance from the point to the -axis. Note that this distance is just , So a parameterization of the sphere of radius centered at the origin is for and .        The Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Surfaces  Recall that a differentiable function is locally linear that is, if we zoom in on the surface around a point, the surface looks like its tangent plane. We now exploit this idea in order to determine the surface area generated by a parametrization . The basic idea is a familiar one: we will subdivide the surface into small pieces, in the approximate shape of small parallelograms, and thus estimate the entire the surface area by adding the areas of these approximation parallelograms. Ultimately, we use an integral to sum these approximations and determine the exact surface area.  Let define a surface over a rectangular domain and . As a function of two variables, and , it is natural to consider the two partial derivatives of the vector-valued function , which we define by   In the usual way, we slice the domain into small rectangles. In particular, we partition the interval into subintervals of length and let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . Also partition the interval into subintervals of equal length and let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle in -coordinates into sub-rectangles with opposite vertices and for between and and between and . These rectangles all have equal area .  Now we want to think about the small piece of area on the surface itself that lies above one of these small rectangles in the domain. Observe that if we increase by a small amount from the point in the domain, then changes by approximately . Similarly, if we increase by a small amount from the point , then changes by approximately . So we can approximate the surface defined by on the -rectangle with the parallelogram determined by the vectors and , as seen in Figure .   Approximation surface area with a parallelogram.    Say that the small parallelogram has area . If we can find its area, then all that remains is to sum the areas of all of the generated parallelograms and take a limit. Recall from our earlier work in the course that given two vectors and , the area of the parallelogram spanned by and is given by the magnitude of their cross product, . In the present context, it follows that the area, , of the parallelogram determined by the vectors and is where the latter equality holds from standard properties of the cross product and length.  We sum the surface area approximations from Equation over all sub-rectangles to obtain an estimate for the total surface area, , given by   Taking the limit as shows that the surface area of the surface defined by over the domain is given as follows.   Surface area  Let be a parameterization of a smooth surface over a domain . The area of the surface surface area defined by on is given by      Consider the cylinder with radius and height defined parametrically by for and , as shown in Figure .   A cylinder.       Set up an iterated integral to determine the surface area of this cylinder.    Evaluate the iterated integral.    Recall that one way to think about the surface area of a cylinder is to cut the cylinder horizontally and find the perimeter of the resulting cross sectional circle, then multiply by the height. Calculate the surface area of the given cylinder using this alternate approach, and compare your work in (b).          We have , so the area of the surface of the cylinder is . In this case, , so an iterated integral that represents the area of the surface is .    We can find the surface area of the cylinder by multiplying the circumference of the circle of radius by the height to obtain . Evaluating the iterated integral yields .    If we slice the cylinder horizontally, a cross section is a circle of radius . The circumference of this circle is . We multiply by the height of the cylinder to obtain the surface area as as expected.       As we noted earlier, we can take any surface and generate a corresponding parameterization for the surface by writing . Hence, we can use our recent work with parametrically defined surfaces to find the surface area that is generated by a function over a given domain.    Let define a smooth surface, and consider the corresponding parameterization .   Let be a region in the domain of . Using Equation , show that the area, , of the surface defined by the graph of over is     Use the formula developed in (a) to calculate the area of the surface defined by over the rectangle .    Observe that the surface of the solid describe in (b) is half of a circular cylinder. Use the standard formula for the surface area of a cylinder to calculate the surface area in a different way, and compare your result from (b).          Recall that any surface defined by a function in Cartesian coordinates can be thought of as a surface defined parametrically with parameters and by . The surface is then given by the vector-valued function with . In this case we have . So , and the formula for surface area becomes .    Using the formula from part (a) we have that the surface area is .    The cross sections of the surface of this solid are semicircles with radius 2. So the surface area of this solid should be .         Summary    A parameterization of a curve describes the coordinates of a point on the curve in terms of a single parameter , while a parameterization of a surface describes the coordinates of points on the surface in terms of two independent parameters.    If describes a smooth surface in 3-space on a domain , then the area, , of that surface is given by         Consider the cone shown below.   If the height of the cone is 7 and the base radius is 9, write a parameterization of the cone in terms of and .   ,   , and   , with    and    .                                      and angle , we find , and in terms of the parameters and . We have  and with There are, of course, other parameterizations, but they will not be in terms of and , as required in this problem.        Parameterize the plane through the point with the normal vector    (Use and for the parameters in your parameterization, and enter your vector as a single vector, with angle brackets : e.g., as \\lt 1 + s + t, s - t, 3 - t \\gt .)        and that are parallel to the plane. Such vectors are perpendicular to the normal vector to the plane, . We can choose any vectors and such that . One choice is Letting , we have the parameterization         Parameterize a vase formed by rotating the curve , around the -axis. Use and for your parameters.   ,   , and   , with    and                                         , , around the -axis is shown in the figure below. At height , the cross-section is a horizontal circle of radius . Thus, letting the angle around the -axis be , a point on this horizontal circle is given by However, the radius and height are not independent. We can parameterize easily in two ways: first, suppose that we take the radius to be our second parameter, . Then, the height , and our parameterization is  and with Alternately, we could take the height to be the second parameter, . Then, solving for the radius in the expression for the curve, we get . Thus in this case the parameterization is  and with         Find parametric equations for the sphere centered at the origin and with radius 4. Use the parameters and in your answer.   ,   , and   , where    and    .                                      and as the two parameters. Since the radius is 4, we can take with         Find the surface area of that part of the plane that lies inside the elliptic cylinder  Surface Area =              Find the surface area of the part of the circular paraboloid that lies inside the cylinder .

Write down the iterated integral which expresses the surface area of over the triangle with vertices (-1,1), (1,1), (0,2):                                             A decorative oak post is 48 inches long and is turned on a lathe so that its profile is sinusoidal as shown in the figure below.   In this figure, inches and inches.  (a) Describe the surface of the post parametrically using cylindrical coordinates and the parameters and .   ,   , and   , where    and    .  (b) Find the volume of the post.  volume =  (Include units .)                                           (a) Let be measured from the bottom of the post, and the center of the post be at , . The surface is the revolution surface obtained by revolving a curve extending vertically along one edge of the surface around the axis, as suggested by the figure below. From the measurements given, we obtain the equation of the curve Rotating this around the -axis, taking and as the parameters, we get the parametric equations  and with  (b) We know that the points in the curve consists of cross-sections of circles parallel to the plane and of radius . Thus, Integrating over , we get        Consider the ellipsoid given by the equation   In Activity , we found that a parameterization of the sphere of radius centered at the origin is for and .   Let be a point on the ellipsoid and let , , and . Show that lies on the sphere . Hence, find a parameterization of in terms of , , and as functions of and .    Use the result of part (a) to find a parameterization of the ellipse in terms of , , and as functions of and . Check your parametrization by substituting , , and into the equation of the ellipsoid. Then check your work by plotting the surface defined by your parameterization.         If lies on the ellipse and , , and , then . So lies on the sphere and has parameterization for and .    Since , , and we have for and . Note that . So , , and is a parametrization of the ellipse.       In this exercise, we explore how to use a parametrization and iterated integral to determine the surface area of a sphere.   Set up an iterated integral whose value is the portion of the surface area of a sphere of radius that lies in the first octant (see the parameterization you developed in Activity ).    Then, evaluate the integral to calculate the surface area of this portion of the sphere.    By what constant must you multiply the value determined in (b) in order to find the total surface area of the entire sphere.    Finally, compare your result to the standard formula for the surface area of sphere.         From Activity we know that a parameterization of a sphere of radius centered at the origin is for and in . By symmetry, we can just calculate the surface area of the sphere in the first octant, then multiply by 8. So we can assume .    With we have , and so . Therefore, the surface area of the first octant portion of the sphere is .    We multiply the previous result by 8 to reproduce the surface area calculation in each of the eight octants. So the surface area of a sphere of radius is .    The result of part (c) is the standard formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius .       Consider the plane generated by over the region .   Sketch a picture of the overall solid generated by the plane over the given domain.    Determine a parameterization for the plane over the domain .    Use Equation to determine the surface area generated by over the domain .    Observe that the vector points from to along one side of the surface generated by the plane over . Find the vector such that and together span the parallelogram that represents the surface defined by over , and hence compute . What do you observe about the value you find?         The solid looks like a box with a slanted top.    If we let and , then provides a parameterization of the plane. So we can let .    In our situation we have and . So . So the surface area generated by over the domain is found by .    Take to be the vector that points from to along one side of the surface generated by the plane over . Then and together span the parallelogram that represents the surface defined by over . Here we have . Since is the area of the parallelogram determined by and , we should expect this area to be the same as the surface area of the surface defined by the plane over .       A cone with base radius and height can be realized as the surface defined by , where and are positive.   Find a parameterization of the cone described by . (Hint: Compare to the parameterization of a cylinder as seen in Activity .)    Set up an iterated integral to determine the surface area of this cone.

By similar triangles, the cross section of the cone at height parallel to the - plane has radius . We can think of the cone as made of circles with these varying radii, so a parameterization of the cone is , for and .    We have , and . By symmetry, we calculate the area of the cone in the first octant and multiply by 4 to obtain the area of the surface of the cone as .    Evaluating the iterated integral yields .       "

  "body": " Triple Integrals     How are a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral of a continuous function defined?    What are two things the triple integral of a function can tell us?      We have now learned that we define the double integral of a continuous function over a rectangle as a limit of a double Riemann sum, and that these ideas parallel the single-variable integral of a function on an interval . Moreover, this double integral has natural interpretations and applications, and can even be considered over non-rectangular regions, . For instance, given a continuous function over a region , the average value of , , is given by where is the area of . Likewise, if describes a mass density function on a lamina over , the mass, , of the lamina is given by   It is natural to wonder if it is possible to extend these ideas of double Riemann sums and double integrals for functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums and then triple integrals for functions of three variables. We begin investigating in Preview Activity .    Consider a solid piece of granite in the shape of a box , whose density varies from point to point. Let represent the mass density of the piece of granite at point in kilograms per cubic meter (so we are measuring , , and in meters). Our goal is to find the mass of this solid.  Recall that if the density was constant, we could find the mass by multiplying the density and volume; since the density varies from point to point, we will use the approach we did with two-variable lamina problems, and slice the solid into small pieces on which the density is roughly constant.  Partition the interval into 2 subintervals of equal length, the interval into 3 subintervals of equal length, and the interval into 2 subintervals of equal length. This partitions the box into sub-boxes as shown in Figure .   A partitioned three-dimensional domain.      Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. Draw a picture of Figure and label these endpoints on your drawing. Do likewise with and What is the length of each subinterval for from 1 to 2? the length of ? of ?    The partitions of the intervals , and partition the box into sub-boxes. How many sub-boxes are there? What is volume of each sub-box?    Let denote the sub-box . Say that we choose a point in the th sub-box for each possible combination of . What is the meaning of ? What physical quantity will approximate?    What final step(s) would it take to determine the exact mass of the piece of granite?         We have , , and ; , , , and ; and , , and . This gives us , , and . These points are labeled in figure below.     Since we partition the interval into 2 subintervals, the interval into 3 subintervals, and the interval into 2 subintervals, there are sub-boxes of . Each sub-box has volume .    The visible sub-boxes are labeled in the figure. Notice that we cannot see boxes . If we consider the mass of the solid in sub-box as a constant in kilograms per cubic meter, then the product will approximate the mass of the solid on sub-box .    To determine the mass of our solid, we sum the approximations of the masses on each sub-box and the take the limit as , , and go to 0. Thus, the mass of our solid is .         Triple Riemann Sums and Triple Integrals  Through the application of a mass density distribution over a three-dimensional solid, Preview Activity suggests that the generalization from double Riemann sums of functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums of functions of three variables is natural. In the same way, so is the generalization from double integrals to triple integrals. By simply adding a -coordinate to our earlier work, we can define both a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral.    Let be a continuous function on a box . The triple Riemann sum of over triple Riemann sum is created as follows.   Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . Do likewise with the interval using subintervals of equal length to generate , and with the interval using subintervals of equal length to have .    Let be the sub-box of with opposite vertices and for between and , between and , and between 1 and . The volume of each is .    Let be a point in box for each , , and . The resulting triple Riemann sum for on is        If represents the mass density of the box , then, as we saw in Preview Activity , the triple Riemann sum approximates the total mass of the box . In order to find the exact mass of the box, we need to let the number of sub-boxes increase without bound (in other words, let , , and go to infinity); in this case, the finite sum of the mass approximations becomes the actual mass of the solid . More generally, we have the following definition of the triple integral.    With following notation defined as in a triple Riemann sum, the triple integral of over triple integral is     As we noted earlier, if represents the density of the solid at each point , then is the mass of . mass of a solid Even more importantly, for any continuous function over the solid , we can use a triple integral to determine the average value of over , . We note this generalization of our work with functions of two variables along with several others in the following important boxed information. Note that each of these quantities may actually be considered over a general domain in , not simply a box, .   The triple integral represents the volume of the solid volume of a solid .    The average value of the function over a solid domain average value over a solid is given by where is the volume of the solid .    The center of mass center of mass of a solid of the solid with density is , where and is the mass of the solid .     In the Cartesian coordinate system, the volume element is , and, as a consequence, a triple integral of a function over a box in Cartesian coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral of the form   If we want to evaluate a triple integral as an iterated integral over a solid that is not a box, then we need to describe the solid in terms of variable limits.       Set up and evaluate the triple integral of over the box .    Let be the solid cone bounded by and . A picture of is shown at right in Figure . Our goal in what follows is to set up an iterated integral of the form to represent the mass of in the setting where tells us the density of at the point . Our particular task is to find the limits on each of the three integrals.  Left: The cone. Right: Its projection.         If we think about slicing up the solid, we can consider slicing the domain of the solid's projection onto the -plane (just as we would slice a two-dimensional region in ), and then slice in the -direction as well. The projection of the solid onto the -plane is shown at left in Figure . If we decide to first slice the domain of the solid's projection perpendicular to the -axis, over what range of constant -values would we have to slice?    If we continue with slicing the domain, what are the limits on on a typical slice? How do these depend on ? What, therefore, are the limits on the middle integral?    Finally, now that we have thought about slicing up the two-dimensional domain that is the projection of the cone, what are the limits on in the innermost integral? Note that over any point in the plane, a vertical slice in the direction will involve a range of values from the cone itself to its flat top. In particular, observe that at least one of these limits is not constant but depends on and .    In conclusion, write an iterated integral of the form that represents the mass of the cone .             As an iterated integral we have .      The values of run from to .    The projection of the cone onto the -plane is image of the top of the cone, or the equation . This is the circle . The limits on are from the bottom of the circle to the top, or .    Notice that the smallest value of on each slice is on the cone, and the largest value of is on the plane . So the limits on are .    An iterated integral that represents the mass of the cone is .          Note well: When setting up iterated integrals, the limits on a given variable can be only in terms of the remaining variables. In addition, there are multiple different ways we can choose to set up such an integral. For example, two possibilities for iterated integrals that represent a triple integral over a solid are              where , , , , , , , and are functions of the indicated variables. There are four other options beyond the two stated here, since the variables , , and can (theoretically) be arranged in any order. Of course, in many circumstances, an insightful choice of variable order will make it easier to set up an iterated integral, just as was the case when we worked with double integrals.    Find the mass of the tetrahedron in the first octant bounded by the coordinate planes and the plane if the density at point is given by . A picture of the solid tetrahedron is shown at left in Figure .   Left: The tetrahedron. Right: Its projection.       We find the mass, , of the tetrahedron by the triple integral where is the solid tetrahedron described above. In this example, we choose to integrate with respect to first for the innermost integral. The top of the tetrahedron is given by the equation solving for then yields   The bottom of the tetrahedron is the -plane, so the limits on in the iterated integral will be .  To find the bounds on and we project the tetrahedron onto the -plane; this corresponds to setting in the equation . The resulting relation between and is   The right image in Figure shows the projection of the tetrahedron onto the -plane.  If we choose to integrate with respect to for the middle integral in the iterated integral, then the lower limit on is the -axis and the upper limit is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Note that the hypotenuse joins the points and and so has equation . Thus, the bounds on are . Finally, the values run from 0 to 6, so the iterated integral that gives the mass of the tetrahedron is   Evaluating the triple integral gives us     Setting up limits on iterated integrals can require considerable geometric intuition. It is important to not only create carefully labeled figures, but also to think about how we wish to slice the solid. Further, note that when we say we will integrate first with respect to , by first we are referring to the innermost integral in the iterated integral. The next activity explores several different ways we might set up the integral in the preceding example.    There are several other ways we could have set up the integral to give the mass of the tetrahedron in Example .   How many different iterated integrals could be set up that are equal to the integral in Equation ?    Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to , then , then that is equivalent to the integral in Equation . Before you write down the integral, think about Figure , and draw an appropriate two-dimensional image of an important projection.    Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to , then , then that is equivalent to the integral in Equation . As in (b), think carefully about the geometry first.    Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to , then , then that is equivalent to the integral in Equation .          We can choose any of , , or to be our innermost variable of integration. Once we make that choice, there are two variables left for the middle integral, and then only one for the outermost integral. So we have different iterated integrals that are equal to the integral in .    If we integrate with respect to first, the limits on will remain the same as in . The projection of the tetrahedron onto the -plane is still bounded by the line , and this region can be described by the inequalities and . So our iterated integral is .    If we integrate with respect to first, the lower limit on is 0 and the upper limit is the face of the tetrahedron, . The projection of the tetrahedron onto the -plane is bounded by the coordinate axes and the line . This region can be described by the inequalities and . So our iterated integral is .    If we integrate with respect to first, the lower limit on is 0 and the upper limit is the face of the tetrahedron, . The projection of the tetrahedron onto the -plane is bounded by the coordinate axes and the line . This region can be described by the inequalities and . So our iterated integral is .       Now that we have begun to understand how to set up iterated triple integrals, we can apply them to determine important quantities, such as those found in the next activity.    A solid is bounded below by the square , , and above by the surface . A picture of the solid is shown in Figure .   The solid bounded by the surface .      First, set up an iterated double integral to find the volume of the solid as a double integral of a solid under a surface. Then set up an iterated triple integral that gives the volume of the solid . You do not need to evaluate either integral. Compare the two approaches.    Set up (but do not evaluate) iterated integral expressions that will tell us the center of mass of , if the density at point is .    Set up (but do not evaluate) an iterated integral to find the average density on using the density function from part (b).    Use technology appropriately to evaluate the iterated integrals you determined in (a), (b), and (c); does the location you determined for the center of mass make sense?        We integrate first with respect to , so that . The projection of the surface onto the -plane is the square, so an iterated integral that gives the volume of is .    The center of mass of is , where .    The average density is given by .    The volume of the solid is , the center of mass is , and the average density is . Given the symmetry, we should expect and to be 0. Since the bulk of the mass is nearer to the -plane, it makes sense that is less than 1.        Summary    Let be a continuous function on a box . The triple integral of over is defined as where the triple Riemann sum is defined in the usual way. The definition of the triple integral naturally extends to non-rectangular solid regions .    The triple integral can tell us   -  the volume of the solid if ,    -  the mass of the solid if represents the density of at the point .   Moreover, is the average value of over .

Note that the projection of this into the -plane is the triangular region below . The mass of the volume is then Integrating with respect to , so that Then, integrating with respect to , Expanding the these terms, we have         The moment of inertia of a solid body about an axis in 3-space relates the angular acceleration about this axis to torque (force twisting the body). The moments of inertia about the coordinate axes of a body of constant density and mass occupying a region of volume are defined to be  Use these definitions to find the moment of inertia about the -axis of the rectangular solid of mass given by , , .                        of the solid is .

In polar coordinates, the graph of is a line through the origin making an angle of 2 radians with the positive -axis. Extending this to cylindrical coordinates, the graph of is a plane through the origin perpendicular to the -plane making an angle of 2 radians with the -plane.    The graph of is just a plane parallel to the -plane at a distance 2 above the -plane. With and , the graph of is just a disk of radius 2 centered at within the plane .    For a fixed value of , the graph of and is a circle of radius in the plane . As increases the radii increase, so we will obtain a cone with base at the origin, opening up with height .    For a fixed , the graph of is a line in the plane making an angle of with the -plane. Allowing to vary will produce a set of lines, spiraling upward so that the result looks like a bit of an auger.       As the name and Activity suggests, cylindrical coordinates are useful for describing surfaces that are cylindrical in nature.    Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates  To evaluate a triple integral as an iterated integral in Cartesian coordinates, we use the fact that the volume element is equal to (which corresponds to the volume of a small box). To evaluate a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates, we similarly must understand the volume element in cylindrical coordinates.    A picture of a cylindrical box, is shown in Figure . Let , , and . We want to determine the volume of in terms of , , , , , and .   A cylindrical box.       Appropriately label , , and in Figure .    Let be the area of the projection of the box, , onto the -plane, which is shaded blue in Figure . Recall that we previously determined the area in polar coordinates in terms of , , and . In light of the fact that we know and that is the standard coordinate from Cartesian coordinates, what is the volume in cylindrical coordinates?          The labels are shown below.     Recall that was . Since is just the standard height, we have .        Activity demonstrates that the volume element in cylindrical coordinates is given by , and hence the following rule holds in general.   Triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates  Given a continuous function over a region in ,   The latter expression is an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates . iterated integral cylindrical coordinates    Of course, to complete the task of writing an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates, we need to determine the limits on the three integrals: , , and . In the following activity, we explore how to do this in several situations where cylindrical coordinates are natural and advantageous.    In this activity we work with triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates.   Let be the solid bounded above by the graph of and below by on the unit disk in the -plane.   The projection of the solid onto the -plane is a disk. Describe this disk using polar coordinates.    Now describe the surfaces bounding the solid using cylindrical coordinates.    Determine an iterated triple integral expression in cylindrical coordinates that gives the volume of . You do not need to evaluate this integral.       Suppose the density of the cone defined by , with , is given by . A picture of the cone is shown at left in Figure , and the projection of the cone onto the -plane in given at right in Figure . Set up an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates that gives the mass of the cone. You do not need to evaluate this integral.  The cylindrical cone and its projection onto the -plane.          Determine an iterated integral expression in cylindrical coordinates whose value is the volume of the solid bounded below by the cone and above by the cone . A picture is shown in Figure . You do not need to evaluate this integral.  A solid bounded by the cones and .             Since in cylindrical coordinates, our limits on will be . Thus, an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates that gives the volume of is . Now .    Recall that mass is the integral of density, so the mass of the cone is . The cone is bounded below by the -plane and above by the surface . If we integrate with respect to first, then the limits on are . When can project the surface into the -plane as shown in Figure to find the limits on and . Note than when we have , so the projection is a circle with radius centered at the origin. Therefore, the mass of the cone given the the iterated integral .    In cylindrical coordinates the cones are and . So we have . Now and intersect when or when . So the projection of this solid in the -plane is the disk and . So an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates that gives the volume of this solid is .         Spherical Coordinates  When it comes to thinking about particular surfaces in spherical coordinates, similar to our work with cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, we usually write as a function of and ; this is a natural analog to polar coordinates, where we often think of our distance from the origin in the plane as being a function of . In spherical coordinates, we likewise often view as a function of and , thus viewing distance from the origin as a function of two key angles.  In the following activity, we explore several basic equations in spherical coordinates and the surfaces they generate.    In this activity, we graph some surfaces using spherical coordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should first think about what each graph should look like before you plot it using appropriate technology.   What familiar surface is described by the points in spherical coordinates with , , and ? How does this particular example demonstrate the reason for the name of this coordinate system? What if we restrict to ?    What familiar surface is described by the points in spherical coordinates with , , and ?    What familiar shape is described by the points in spherical coordinates with , , and ?    Plot the graph of , for and . How does the resulting surface appear?          Since measures the distance from the origin to a point, the graph of is the set of all points that are a distance 1 from the origin. This makes the equation of the sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin.    All points with are at a fixed angle from the positive -axis. The set of such points with is a cone making an angle of with the positive -axis having a slant height of 1.    As in cylindrical coordinates, the graph of is a plane through the origin perpendicular to the -plane making an angle of 2 radians with the -plane. With and , we obtain a semicircle or radius 1 centered at the origin in this plane.    For a fixed value of , the graph of is an intersection of a sphere of radius centered at the origin with a plane through the origin. If , then we get a semicircle. As increases from to , the radii of the semicircles increase, leaving us with a surface that looks like a snail shell.       As the name and Activity indicate, spherical coordinates are particularly useful for describing surfaces that are spherical in nature; they are also convenient for working with certain conical surfaces.    Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates  As with rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, a triple integral in spherical coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral once we understand the volume element .    To find the volume element in spherical coordinates, we need to understand how to determine the volume of a spherical box of the form (with , (with ), and (with ). An illustration of such a box is given at left in Figure . This spherical box is a bit more complicated than the cylindrical box we encountered earlier. In this situation, it is easier to approximate the volume than to compute it directly. Here we can approximate the volume of this spherical box with the volume of a Cartesian box whose sides have the lengths of the sides of this spherical box. In other words, where denotes the length of the circular arc from to .   Left: A spherical box. Right: A spherical volume element.          What is the length in terms of ?    What is the length of the arc ? (Hint: The arc is an arc of a circle of radius , and arc length along a circle is the product of the angle measure (in radians) and the circle's radius.)    What is the length of the arc ? (Hint: The arc lies on a horizontal circle as illustrated at right in Figure . What is the radius of this circle?)    Use your work in (a), (b), and (c) to determine an approximation for in spherical coordinates.          The length is just .    This arc is a fraction of the entire circle of radius , so its length is .    The radius of the on which the arc lies is , so the length of the arc is .    The results from the previous parts of this activity show that . Letting , , and go to 0 gives us .       Letting , , and go to 0, it follows from the final result in Activity that in spherical coordinates, and thus allows us to state the following general rule.   Triple integrals in spherical coordinates  Given a continuous function over a region in , the triple integral is converted to the integral in spherical coordinates.  The latter expression is an iterated integral in spherical coordinates iterated integral spherical coordinates .   Finally, in order to actually evaluate an iterated integral in spherical coordinates, we must of course determine the limits of integration in , , and . The process is similar to our earlier work in the other two coordinate systems.    We can use spherical coordinates to help us more easily understand some natural geometric objects.   Recall that the sphere of radius has spherical equation . Set up and evaluate an iterated integral in spherical coordinates to determine the volume of a sphere of radius .    Set up, but do not evaluate, an iterated integral expression in spherical coordinates whose value is the mass of the solid obtained by removing the cone from the sphere if the density at the point is . An illustration of the solid is shown in Figure .  The solid cut from the sphere by the cone .             Recall that the volume of a solid is given by . Thus, the volume of a sphere of radius can be calculated as an iterated integral as follows: .    The limits on are and on are . To account for the cone being removed from the sphere we restrict . The cone opens from to , so the limits on that remove the cone are . Therefore, the density of the solid is found by .         Summary     The cylindrical coordinates of a point are where is the distance from the origin to the projection of onto the -plane, is the angle that the projection of onto the -plane makes with the positive -axis, and is the vertical distance from to the projection of onto the -plane. When has rectangular coordinates , it follows that its cylindrical coordinates are given by When has given cylindrical coordinates , its rectangular coordinates are     The volume element in cylindrical coordinates is . Hence, a triple integral can be evaluated as the iterated integral     The spherical coordinates of a point in 3-space are (rho), , and (phi), where is the distance from to the origin, is the angle that the projection of onto the -plane makes with the positive -axis, and is the angle between the positive axis and the vector from the origin to .

The surface is a paraboloid with a rounded cap. Cross sections with constant values are generally larger as the values increase, with the exception of a rapid decrease in areas near the top. This suggests that the average value should be more than half-way up the solid.       "

  "body": " Change of Variables     What is a change of variables?    What is the Jacobian, and how is it related to a change of variables?      In single variable calculus, we encountered the idea of a change of variable in a definite integral through the method of substitution. For example, given the definite integral we naturally consider the change of variable . From this substitution, it follows that , and since implies and implies , we have transformed the original integral in into a new integral in . In particular,   The latter integral, of course, is far easier to evaluate.  Through our work with polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, we have already implicitly seen some of the issues that arise in using a change of variables with two or three variables present. In what follows, we seek to understand the general ideas behind any change of variables in a multiple integral.    Consider the double integral where is the upper half of the unit disk.      Write the double integral given in Equation as an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates.    Write the double integral given in Equation  as an iterated integral in polar coordinates.      When we write the double integral as an iterated integral in polar coordinates we make a change of variables, namely   We also then have to change to . This process also identifies a polar rectangle  with the original Cartesian rectangle, under the transformation A transformation is another name for function: here, the equations and define a function by so that is a function (transformation) from to . We view this transformation as mapping a version of the -plane where the axes are viewed as representing and (the -plane) to the familiar -plane. in Equation . The vertices of the polar rectangle are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded region in rectangular coordinates.  To work with a numerical example, let's now consider the polar rectangle given by , so that , , , and .    Use the transformation determined by the equations in to find the rectangular vertices that correspond to the polar vertices in the polar rectangle . In other words, by substituting appropriate values of and into the two equations in , find the values of the corresponding and coordinates for the vertices of the polar rectangle . Label the point that corresponds to the polar vertex as , the point corresponding to the polar vertex as , the point corresponding to the polar vertex as , and the point corresponding to the polar vertex as .    Draw a picture of the figure in rectangular coordinates that has the points , , , and as vertices. (Note carefully that because of the trigonometric functions in the transformation, this region will not look like a Cartesian rectangle.) What is the area of this region in rectangular coordinates? How does this area compare to the area of the original polar rectangle?          The double integral can be evaluated in rectangular coordinates as the iterated integral .    By making the change of variables and , and , we express the double integral as the iterated integral in polar coordinates.    Under the transformations in    the vertex is sent to the point ,    the vertex is sent to the point ,    the vertex is sent to the point ,    the vertex is sent to the point .       If we lived in polar coordinates, the polar rectangle would look to us as shown below at left. The image of the polar rectangle under the transformations in is shown below at right.  We have seen that the area of the transformed rectangle is given by , and as and go to 0 this area becomes the area element . This is the general idea of a change of variables in multiple integrals.        Change of Variables in Polar Coordinates  The general idea behind a change of variables is suggested by Preview Activity . There, we saw that in a change of variables from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, a polar rectangle gets mapped to a Cartesian rectangle under the transformation   The vertices of the polar rectangle are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded region in rectangular coordinates. If we view the standard coordinate system as having the horizontal axis represent and the vertical axis represent , then the polar rectangle appears to us at left in Figure . The image of the polar rectangle under the transformation given by is shown at right in Figure . We thus see that there is a correspondence between a simple region (a traditional, right-angled rectangle) and a more complicated region (a fraction of an annulus) under the function given by .   A rectangle and its image .    Furthermore, as Preview Activity suggests, it follows generally that for an original polar rectangle , the area of the transformed rectangle is given by . Therefore, as and go to 0 this area becomes the familiar area element in polar coordinates. When we proceed to working with other transformations for different changes in coordinates, we have to understand how the transformation affects area so that we may use the correct area element in the new system of variables.    General Change of Coordinates  We first focus on double integrals. As with single integrals, we may be able to simplify a double integral of the form by making a change of variables (that is, a substitution) of the form where and are functions of new variables and . This transformation introduces a correspondence between a problem in the -plane and one in the the -plane. The equations and convert and to and ; we call these formulas the change of variable formulas. To complete the change to the new variables, we need to understand the area element, , in this new system. The following activity helps to illustrate the idea.    Consider the change of variables   Let's see what happens to the rectangle in the -plane under this change of variable.   Draw a labeled picture of in the -plane.    Find the image of the -vertex in the -plane. Likewise, find the respective images of the other three vertices of the rectangle : , , and .    In the -plane, draw a labeled picture of the image, , of the original -rectangle . What appears to be the shape of the image, ?    To transform an integral with a change of variables, we need to determine the area element for image of the transformed rectangle. Note that is not exactly a parallelogram since the equations that define the transformation are not linear. But we can approximate the area of with the area of a parallelogram. How would we find the area of a parallelogram that approximates the area of the -figure ? (Hint: Remember what the cross product of two vectors tells us.)         A picture of the rectangle is shown in the image below.    The -vertex gets sent to the point in the -plane,    The point in the -plane gets sent to the point in the -plane. The point in the -plane gets sent to the point in the -plane. The point in the -plane gets sent to the point in the -plane.    The image of is not a rectangle in the -plane because the change of variable formulas are not linear. The image looks like a parallelogram.    The area of is the area of a parallelogram, which we can find with a cross product. The sides of the parallelogram can be viewed as the vectors and . The area of the parallelogram is then .          Activity presents the general idea of how a change of variables works. We partition a rectangular domain in the system into subrectangles. Let be one of these subrectangles. Then we transform this into a region in the standard Cartesian coordinate system. The region is called the image of ; the region is the pre-image of . Although the sides of this region aren't necessarily straight (linear), we will approximate the element of area for this region with the area of the parallelogram whose sides are given by the vectors and , where is the vector from to , and is the vector from to .  An example of an image in the -plane that results from a transformation of a rectangle in the -plane is shown in Figure .   Approximating an area of an image resulting from a transformation.    The components of the vector are and similarly those for are   Slightly rewriting and , we have   For small and , the definition of the partial derivative tells us that   Recall that the area of the parallelogram with sides and is the length of the cross product of the two vectors, . From this, we observe that   Finally, by computing the magnitude of the cross product, we see that   Therefore, as the number of subdivisions increases without bound in each direction, and both go to zero, and we have   Equation hence determines the general change of variable formula in a double integral, and we can now say that   The quantity is called the Jacobian Jacobian , and we denote the Jacobian using the shorthand notation Recall from Section that we can also write this Jacobian as the determinant of the matrix . Note that, as discussed in Section , the absolute value of the determinant of is the area of the parallelogram determined by the vectors and , and so the area element in -coordinates is also represented by the area element in -coordinates, and is the factor by which the transformation magnifies area.  To summarize, the preceding change of variable formula that we have derived now follows.   Change of Variables in a Double Integral change of variable double integral  Suppose a change of variables and transforms a closed and bounded region in the -plane into a closed and bounded region in the -plane. Under modest conditions (that are studied in advanced calculus), it follows that      Find the Jacobian when changing from rectangular to polar coordinates. That is, for the transformation given by , , determine a simplified expression for the quantity   What do you observe about your result? How is this connected to our earlier work with double integrals in polar coordinates?    In this case we have .  Since we can assume in polar coordinates, the Jacobian is as expected.    Given a particular double integral, it is natural to ask, how can we find a useful change of variables? There are two general factors to consider: if the integrand is particularly difficult, we might choose a change of variables that would make the integrand easier; or, given a complicated region of integration, we might choose a change of variables that transforms the region of integration into one that has a simpler form. These ideas are illustrated in the next activities.    Consider the problem of finding the area of the region defined by the ellipse . Here we will make a change of variables so that the pre-image of the domain is a circle.   Let and . Explain why the pre-image of the original ellipse (which lies in the plane) is the circle in the -plane.    Recall that the area of the ellipse is determined by the double integral . Explain why where is the disk bounded by the circle . In particular, explain the source of the 2 in the integral.    Without evaluating any of the integrals present, explain why the area of the original elliptical region is .         Substituting for and for in our ellipse equation gives us . So the pre-image of the the ellipse in the -plane is the circle .    This is just asking us to find the Jacobian .    We know that is a circle of radius 1 and so has area . Therefore, .        Let be the region in the -plane bounded by the lines , , and . We will evaluate the double integral with a change of variables.    Sketch the region in the -plane.    We would like to make a substitution that makes the integrand easier to antidifferentiate. Let and . Explain why this should make antidifferentiation easier by making the corresponding substitutions and writing the new integrand in terms of and .    Solve the equations and for and . (Doing so determines the standard form of the transformation, since we will have as a function of and , and as a function of and .)    To actually execute this change of variables, we need to know the -region that corresponds to the -region .    What equation corresponds to the equation ?    What equation corresponds to the equation ?    What equation corresponds to the equation ?    Sketch the region that corresponds to the domain .      Make the change of variables indicated by and in the double integral and set up an iterated integral in variables whose value is the original given double integral. Finally, evaluate the iterated integral.        A sketch of the domain is shown below.    This change of variable would make the integrand look like , which separates the variables and makes the integration easier.    A little algebra shows that and .    To make this change of variables, we will need to know the -region that corresponds to the -region .   Using our change of variables we have .    Using our change of variables we have or .    Using our change of variables we have or .    The region is shown below.       We need the Jacobian . Then .           Change of Variables in a Triple Integral  The argument for the change of variable formula for triple integrals is complicated, and we will not go into the details. The general process, though, is the same as the two-dimensional case. Given a solid in the -coordinate system in , a change of variables transformation , , and transforms into a region in -coordinates. Any function defined on can be considered as a function in -coordinates defined on . The volume element in -coordinates cooresponds to a scaled volume element in -coordinates, where the scale factor is given by the absolute value of the Jacobian, , which is the determinant of the matrix . (Recall that this determinant was introduced in Section .) That is, is given by   To summarize,  Change of Variables in a Triple Integral change of variable triple integral  Suppose a change of variables , , and transforms a closed and bounded region in -coordinates into a closed and bounded region in -coordinates. Under modest conditions (that are studied in advanced calculus), the triple integral is equal to      Consider the solid defined by the inequalities , , and . Consider the transformation defined by , , and . Let .   The transformation turns the solid in -coordinates into a box in -coordinates. Apply the transformation to the boundries of the solid to find -coordinatte descriptions of the box .    Find the Jacobian .    Use the transformation to perform a change of variables and evaluate by evaluating .        Summary    If an integral is described in terms of one set of variables, we may write that set of variables in terms of another set of the same number of variables. If the new variables are chosen appropriately, the transformed integral may be easier to evaluate.    The Jacobian is a scalar function that relates the area or volume element in one coordinate system to the corresponding element in a new system determined by a change of variables.        Find the absolute value of the Jacobian, , for the change of variables given by         Therefore,         Find the Jacobian. , where .          This determinant is computed the same way as for the cross product, with the entries in the first row playing the same role as . We get         Consider the transformation  A. Compute the Jacobian:    B. The transformation is linear, which implies that it transforms lines into lines. Thus, it transforms the square into a square with vertices:  T(40, 40) = ( , )  T(-40, 40) = ( , )  T(-40, -40) = ( , )  T(40, -40) = ( , )  C. Use the transformation to evaluate the integral                                                           Use the change of variables , to evaluate over the region in the first quadrant bounded by , , , and .          , the integrand and the region . Inverting the variable change gives , where we use the positive square root because the region is in the first quadrant where . Thus Therefore The integrand is . The region of integration can be transformed by examination of its boundaries. The left and right boundaries of are given by and . The bottom and top boundaries of given by and . Let be the rectangle , of area . We have         Use the change of variables , to find the area of the ellipse .  area =        where is the region . We must change variables in both the area element and the region . Inverting the variable change gives , . Thus Therefore The region of integration is Let be the unit disc . We have         Use the change of variables , to compute , where is the region bounded by .          we have Since So where is the region bounded by , , , . Then         Find positive numbers and so that the change of variables transforms the integral into for the region , the rectangle , and the region , the square .

How do gradients of functions with partial derivatives connect to vector fields?      Vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in and . The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. In a curve is traced by the terminal point of , a function that has a real number as an input and produces a vector in or . In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take a point in (or a point in ) as an input and produce a vector (typically in or , respectively) as output.    It's common when discussing weather to talk about the wind speed , but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at 10 without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing. If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. For instance, if you are taking off in a hot air balloon, the wind direction will determine which direction the chase team should start going to keep track of you. Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind velocity at each point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).    Suppose that given a point in the plane, you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector . For example, we'd then know that at the point , the wind velocity is . We will give the wind velocity as a function , where . In the table below, fill in the wind velocity vectors for the given points.                                          The vector field takes the coordinates of the point and reverses them to make the components of the vector. Thus, . The remaining vectors are shown in the table below.                       Suppose that we associate the vector to a point in the plane. Complete the table below by giving the vector associated to each of the given points.                                                          Note that another way of writing is . Thus, , for example. The remaining answers are found in the table below.                                     A table of values of these vector-valued functions is useful to understand the input vs. output nature of a vector field as a function, but perhaps even better is a method of visualizing the vector outputs. A good picture is worth a thousand words (or numbers). Returning to our analogy of the output vector for our vector field being wind velocity, if , this means that at the location the wind is moving in the direction given by . Thus, we draw the output vector with its initial point at .  Using the first set of axes in , plot the vectors for the five points in the table in part . The example is drawn for you.        Using the second set of axes in , plot the vectors for the eight points in the table in part .   Axes for plotting some vectors from and .    Axes for a rectangular coordinate system.

Examples of Vector Fields  As showed, a velocity vector field is an example of a scenario where associating a vector to each point in a region is useful. We denote such a vector field by or , where the vector associated to the point or is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.

Green vectors representing the velocity vectors of a flowing fluid. The vectors along the vertical axis of syymmetry are directed from bottom to top and are longest in the middle. Vectors on either side of the vertical axis of symmetry form circular rotation patterns, clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. In the upper left corner, there is an inset figure that enlarges the center of rotation on the left side of the image.    Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects which is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth. The magnitude of the force vector is determined by the distance between the object and the earth (by an reciprocal squared relationship.) An illustration of this vector field can be seen in , where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at larger distances from the origin (Earth).   Gravitational vector field.       Mathematical Vector Fields  As suggested in the introduction and , vector fields can be specified using the notation of functions and vectors.    A vector field vectorfield definition in -space is function whose value at a point is a -dimensional vector . Similarly, in -space, a vector field is a function whose value at the point is a -dimensional vector.    Since is a vector, it has , , and components. Each of these components is a scalar function of the point , and so we will often write   For example, if , then the component functions of would be , , and . Any time we are considering a vector field , the definitions of functions , , and should be inferred in this manner. (For a vector field in -space, we only have the functions and , which are defined analogously.)    Plotting Vector Fields   gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields and . It would be impossible to sketch all of the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computers can do a great job of making such sketches. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors in computer plots are typically scaled, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in this text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field in .   Two plots of from Sage    A vector field in the plane with both axes ranging from to . Vectors point from the point to the point .     A vector field in the plane with both axes ranging from to . Vectors are shorter closer to the origin and longer farther away. At the left and right sides, the vectors follow arcs oriented clockwise. At the top and right sides, the vectors follow arcs oriented counterclockwise.      The left plot shows some of the vectors and accurately depicts all of their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand, especially along the lines and . The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform rescaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vector's direction is completely accurate, but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the relative magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.    The plot in illustrates the vector field .   The vector field   A vector field plotted in the plane with and both ranging from to . The vectors have a counterclockwise rotation about the origin, with vectors getting progressively longer as they get farther from the origin.       Starting with one of the vectors near the point , sketch a curve that follows the direction of the vector field . To help visualize what you are doing, it may be useful to think of the vector field as the velocity vector field for some flowing water and that you are imagining tracing the path that a tiny particle inserted into the water would follow as the water moves it around.        Repeat the previous step for at least two other starting points not on the curve you previously sketched.   Plots will be circles centered at the origin with radius given by the distance from the origin to the initial point.    What shape do the curves you sketched in the previous two steps form?   Plots will be circles centered at the origin with radius given by the distance from the origin to the initial point.    Verify that is orthogonal to .   Since , we see that the vectors are orthogonal.    Calculate the gradient of the function and write a sentence comparing your result to the vector .   We find that . Thus, meaning the vector field is multiple of the gradient of the function .    Write a sentence describing the geometric relationship between and a circle centered at the origin. What is the relationship between and the radius of that circle?   We know that the circle is a level curve of the function , and hence is orthogonal to that circle. Since is orthogonal to (a multiple of) the gradient of , we know that is tangent to the circle. Noticing that , we see that the magnitude of is equal to the radius of the circle to which it is tangent.    In the previous activity, we looked a special type of curve in a vector field, namely the curve that flows with the output of the vector field. Geometrically, the output vectors of the vector field will be tangent to the flow curves. These flow curves come up in several physical situations, including as solution curves to a system of differential equations. We will not discuss these applications here but you should should look out for uses of vector fields in the next few math courses.    Gradient Vector Fields  Without using the terminology, we've actually already encountered one very important family of vector fields a number of times. Given a function of two or three (or more!) variables, the gradient of is a vector field, since for any point where has first-order partial derivatives, assigns a vector to that point (look at for a review).    In there are three sets of axes showing level curves for functions , , and , respectively. Sketch at least six vectors in the gradient vector field for each function. In making your sketches, you don't have to worry about getting vector magnitudes precise, but you should ensure that the relative magnitudes (and directions) are correct for each function independently.   Three sets of level curves      Eight skew ellipses centered at the origin. The major axis of the ellipses is the line . Labels on the ellipses range from to in increments of . The axes range approximately from to .        Seven equally-spaced lines with slope plotted on axes that range approximately from to . The lines are labeled from to increments of .        Axes ranging from to . In each quadrant, there are nested curves that appear like rounded squares far out and proceed toward circles in the middle. The curves are all labeled with either or .        The gradients need to be perpendicular to the curve at the points you choose.    Verify that is a gradient vector field by finding a function such that . For reasons originating in physics, such a function is called a potential function for the vector field .   We need to find antiderivatives of the appropriate components with respect to and . For the first component with respect to , we find . For the second component with respect to , we have . Notice here that we may take and (or any constant). Thus, we have .    Is the function found in part unique? That is, can you find another function such that but ?   The function found in part is not unique because we could add any constant and still obtain the same gradient.    Is the vector field a gradient vector field? Why or why not?   We will consider that . So , then . And if then . Therefore, this is not a gradient vector field, which would require that .      Summary     A -dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of whose value is a -dimensional vector. A -dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of whose value is a -dimensional vector.    A vector field is typically described in terms of its multivariable component functions, or in 3D .    Vector fields arise in familiar contexts such as wind velocity, fluid velocity, and gravitational force.    Vector fields are generally plotted in ways that ensure the direction and relative magnitudes of the vectors sketched are correct instead of ensuring that each vector's magnitude is depicted correctly.    The gradient of a function of two or three variables is a vector field defined wherever has partial derivatives.

  "body": "  It's common when discussing weather to talk about the wind speed , but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at 10 without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing. If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. For instance, if you are taking off in a hot air balloon, the wind direction will determine which direction the chase team should start going to keep track of you. Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind velocity at each point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).    Suppose that given a point in the plane, you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector . For example, we'd then know that at the point , the wind velocity is . We will give the wind velocity as a function , where . In the table below, fill in the wind velocity vectors for the given points.                                          The vector field takes the coordinates of the point and reverses them to make the components of the vector. Thus, . The remaining vectors are shown in the table below.                       Suppose that we associate the vector to a point in the plane.

A table of values of these vector-valued functions is useful to understand the input vs. output nature of a vector field as a function, but perhaps even better is a method of visualizing the vector outputs. A good picture is worth a thousand words (or numbers).

  "body": " The Idea of a Line Integral     What is an oriented curve and how can we represent one algebraically?    What is the meaning of the line integral of a vector-valued function along a curve and how can we estimate if its value is positive, negative, or zero?    What are important properties of the line integral of a vector-valued functions along a curve?       Velocity versus Force  Movement by things like air or water will exert a force on objects, so wind velocity vector fields are related to a force field but the relationship between a moving fluid and the force a fluid exerts on an object in the fuild can be complicated. Specifically, issues like drag\/friction and cross sectional area are a critical part of this relationship but are not something that we will focus on in our discussion. In the exploration below, we will look at a simplified version of this situation.   As we discussed in , vector fields are often used to represent forces such as gravity or electromagnetism, as well as the velocity of movement for things like wind or flowing water. We learned in that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the start of its displacement vector to the end. However, this calculation assumes that the force is constant in the region of movement and that the object moves in a straight line along the displacement vector. The situation is more complicated than a dot product calculation when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.  The preview activity uses cardinal directions to specify the direction of displacement vectors. These directions can be described by a compass rose. The compass rose given in is an example of a sixteen point rose. Note that directions like ESE are read as east-southeast half way between east and southeast.   An example of a sixteen point compass rose (from By Brosen~commonswiki - Own work, CC BY 2.5 )   A sixteen point compass rose      Recall from that the work done by a force on an object that moves with displacement vector is . In this Preview Activity, we consider the work done by wind on a helicopter at various stages of its journey.    Our intrepid pilot flies for some time and finds that they are 30 from where they started at a heading of 20 degrees east of due north. During this portion of the trip, the wind is exerting a force of 100 on the helicopter in the due east direction. Find the work the wind has done on the helicopter during the flight.     Here .

Some time later, the pilot determines that they are 25 due north of where they previously checked thier position.

The work done by the wind is thus .    How does your answer to connect to the answers to and ?   Sum.   It is the sum of the answers to the first two parts.    In order to get further away from the storm, the pilot turns and flies 45 west of due north for 50 . The storm the pilot was avoiding has caused the wind to change as well. For this portion of the flight, the wind is exerting a force on the helicopter of 125  in the south direction. Find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during this part of the flight.     The displacement vector is . The work is therefore .    Explain why you cannot take the total displacement of the three parts of the helicopter flight and calculate the total work done by the wind on the helicopter.     The vector field for the wind changes over time.      Orientations of Curves  Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern ourselves with how the object moves. In particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point to the point by first going up the -axis to and then moving horizontally to (illustrated by in ) than if the object moves along the line segment from directly to (illustrated by in ). Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the object moves from to directly along a line segment ( in ). We say that a curve in or is oriented if we have specified the direction of travel along the curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.   Curves , , and demonstrating different paths and orientations between and   Three curves between (0,1) and (4,3)       For each curve below, find a parametrization of the curve. Ensure that each curve's orientation matches the one specified.    The line segment in from to .   for   The direction vector for the line segment is . The line segment starts at . Thus, the line segment given as the vector-valued function .    The line segment in from to .   for   The direction vector for the line segment is . The line segment starts at . Thus, the line segment given as the vector-valued function .    The circle of radius (in ) centered at the origin, beginning at the point and proceeding clockwise around the circle.   for   We can parametrize the circle in question in a clockwise direction as . To get the correct starting point, we require .    In , the portion of the parabola from the point to the point .   for   Here we can let and for .    In general, there are many ways to parametrize an oriented curve. With line segments, it is common to have the parameter range from to , although there are sometimes good reasons to choose another method. For circles and ellipses, you may find it useful to interchange the placement of and to change the orientation, but then careful attention will need to be paid to the start and end points. The interactive graph below allows you to plot parametric curves. You should experiment with the graph below and try to make sense of how changing different elements affects the graph shown below. Remember that you can change the highlighted point using the slider. You should take time now to at least try the following:  Change the upper bound of the plot to  Exchange the sine and cosine functions in and (but do not change the coefficents)  Change the in each of the component functions to  Change the to (you will need to use the exp(t) function in Sage)  Change the upper and lower bounds to get the same curve plotted as in the earlier parts     This is a plot of a parametric curve of the form . For two-dimensional curves, put 0 for .       Line Integrals   showed how we can break up the work done along a path into a sum of work done on each piece. This will be a very helpful idea, especially if we consider the work done by a vector field that is not constant.  For example, let's consider how to measure the work done by , a vector field, along , the curve shown below that goes from to .   A curve oriented from the point to the point with the plot of a vector field   An oriented curve from a point to a point in a vector field     You can see that there will be parts of such that the dot product of the direction of travel and the vector field will be positive and some parts where the dot product is negative. We don't need to consider the output of the vector field except at the points on the curve. Thus, we will look at the following plot of the output of at a collection of points on the curve . Remember that when the vector field is plotted on the whole space, the lengths are rescaled to not be visually cluttered. In the actual output vectors are plotted for some points on .   A curve oriented from the point to the point with the vector field, , plotted at points along the curve   An oriented curve from a point to a point . At points along the curve, there are vectors from the vector field depicted with their tails on the curve.     Since the output of is changing as you move along the path, we will use a type of argument that has come up repeatedly throughout our study of integral calculus. Here we will break our region up into smaller pieces to approximate the work done on each piece. shows how we can break into pieces, which we will call . Note that goes from the point to .   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces    An oriented curve from a point to a point     If we look at one of these smaller pieces (as show in ), we can see that vector field still changes at these points, but the output vectors are very similar. We can also see that the vector is a good approximation of the curve piece . Therefore we can approximate the work done by the vector field on the piece by . Remember that this is the same idea as in ; Namely, the work done is the dot product of the force and the displacement, but this is done on many small pieces instead of the whole path.   A plot of the piece with the output of our vector field plotted at six poins on   The portion of an oriented curve from to . Several vectors from a vector field are shown with their tails on the curve. The vector is also shown in red; it lies very close to the curve portion .     As we increase , the number of pieces of in our approximation, and make sure the length of each piece, , goes to zero, the vector field will be nearly constant on each piece. Additionally, the displacement vector, , will be a better approximation of as increases. This means that our approximation with pieces of would be . We can calculate the exact amount of work done by over by taking the limit of this approximation as the number of pieces increases, while ensuring the size of each piece goes to zero. This should be a familiar Riemann sum argument from earlier definitions involving integration.   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces with the output of plotted at each intermediate point   An oriented curve from a point to a point broken into a sequence of vectors between points along the curve. The vector of a vector field is also shown associated to each of these points.        Let be an oriented curve and a vector field defined in a region containing . The line integral line integral definition of along is , provided the limit exists.    We are able to say a bit here about conditions that guarantee the limit in exists. First, we require that is a relatively nice curve. We say that a curve is smooth provided that it can be parameterized with functions that are infinitely differentiable. We do not require that be smooth, but only that it be piecewise smooth , which means that can be separated into parts which are individually smooth. The other requirement is that is a continuous vector field, by which we mean that each component function of is continuous as a function of or variables (for a large enough region around our curve ).  Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral can each be viewed as the work done by as an object moves along the (very small) vector , the line integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object that moves along (in the direction of its orientation).   Alternative notation for line integrals  Our notation for line integrals is one of several common notations. This notation's strength is that it emphasizes the role of a vector field and dot product. Another common notation for the line integral of a vector field along a curve is . This notation is called the differential form of line integrals and is commonly used in physics and engineering. We will limit ourselves to the notation in the body of the text, but some exercises may use alternative notation. You can find more info at .   If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. Note here that our vector is the displacement from to . If the displacement vector, , and the force field vector, , point in directions with an acute angle between them, the dot product will be positive. We are abusing notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of is points in or , and is a vector. By , we mean , where . On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative. In this case, we also note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. This interpretation carries through with our limit argument above. Specifically, the line integral over a curve will be positive if more of the vector field is in the direction of travel than against the direction of travel. You will need to consider the value of the dot product and not just the sign when assessing whether a line integral will be positive\/neagtive\/zero.    Shown in are two vector fields, and and four oriented curves, as labeled in the plots. For each of the line integrals below, determine if its value should be positive, negative, or zero. Do this by thinking about if the vector field is helping or hindering a particle moving along the oriented curve, rather than by doing calculations.

Thus, the line integral is negative.        Negative   The angle between the vectors of and are all obtuse (except for , where there is no angle), and thus the line integral is negative.        0   The vector field is always orthogonal to . Thus, the line integral is .    The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to efficiently calculate line integrals. As with the limits in the definition of every other type of integral we've studied so far, the limit in the definition of the line integral is is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in the case where the oriented curve is composed of horizontal and vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a single-variable integral, as the following example shows.   Consider the constant vector field . Let be the curve that follows the horizontal line segment from to and then continues down the vertical line segment to . shows and , including the orientation. We will calculate .   An oriented curve from to in a vector field .   The constant vector field as well as an oriented curve consisting of the line segment from to followed by the line segment from to .     To calculate , we start by working with the horizontal line segment. Along that part of , notice that . Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line integral along this portion of consists of terms of the form . Along this part of , ranges from to , and thus we can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral . Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that agrees with the orientation of , we are not surprised to have a positive value here.  Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of . Here , which means that . Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite integral . Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match the orientation of . Also, the negative value should not be unexpected, since is oriented in a direction for which the vectors of point in a direction that would hinder motion along .  Combining these two calculations, we find that .     Properties of Line Integrals  In , we implicitly made use of the idea that if can be broken up into two curves and such that the terminal point of is the initial point of , then the line integral of along is the sum of the line integrals of along and along . This is a generalization of the property for definite integrals that tells us if , then . We next describe some common ways of breaking line integrals into pieces.   Describing Paths in Line Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of line integrals, we will establish some convenient notation. If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analog amongst the properties of definite integrals.

A vector field and six oriented curves.   A vector field in the first quadrant with . Vectors are parallel to the -axis and point in the negative -direction. Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases. There are six labeled oriented curves. The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the lower half of the circle of radius centered at oriented counterclockwise. The curve is the line segment from to .       Is positive, negative, or zero? Explain.   Negative   The portion of the vector field that produces acute angles with has smaller magnitude and smaller length than the portion that produces obtuse angles. Thus, the line integral must be negative.    Let . Determine if is positive, negative, or zero.   Negative   Notice that is orthogonal to and . Thus, . Where the magnitude of the vectors in is larger, points in the opposite direction as the orientation of . Thus, is negative.    Order the line integrals below from smallest to largest.      Notice that is the only one of the six line integrals that is positive, so it is the largest. Since is orthogonal to and , . Note that while is twice as long as , the vectors in the vector field that are hindering are more than twice as long as those hindering Thus, . Thus, the ordering is .      The Circulation of a Vector Field  If an oriented curve ends at the same point where it started, we say that is closed . oriented curve closed The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation circulation of around . To emphasize the fact that is closed, we sometimes write for . Circulation serves as a measure of a vector field's tendency to rotate in a manner consistent with the orientation of the (closed) curve and is measured by looking at whether the vector field is working with or against the motion along the path.    Determine if the circulation of the vector field around each of the closed curves shown in is positive, negative, or zero.   Vector fields and closed curves    A vector field with vectors pointing along circles centered at the origin and in a clockwise direction. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases. Also shown is the circle of radius centered at the origin. The circle is oriented clockwise.     A vector field with all vectors parallel to the -axis. Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases. Vectors with point in the positive -direction, while vectors with point in the negative -direction. Also shown are two rectangles with sides parallel to the axes. One rectangle is oriented counterclockwise; its lower-left corner is at and its upper-right corner is at . The other rectangle is oriented clockwise; its lower-left corner is at and its upper-right corner is at .        Circular curve has positive circulation. Larger rectangular curve has positive circulation. Smaller rectangular curve has negative circulation.    The circular curve is oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The larger rectangular curve is either orthogonal to the vector field or oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The smaller rectangular curve is orthogonal to the vector field or has the opposite orientation. Thus, its circulation is negative.      Summary     An oriented curve can be represented by a vector-valued function of one variable where we interpret the initial and terminal values of the domain of as giving an orientation to the curve. A curve that ends at the same point where it started is said to be closed.    A line integral (of a vector field) measures the extent to which the vector field points in a direction consistent with the orientation of the curve.    Line integrals have many properties that are analogous to those of definite integrals of functions of a single variable.    The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation of the vector field along the curve.         The three figures below show three vector fields. In each case,  determine whether the line integral around the circle (oriented counterclockwise) is positive, negative, or zero.  Note: Use \"0\" for zero, \"P\" for positive, and \"N\" for negative.   (A)    (B)   (C)    0    0    0   The vector line integral of is the integral of the tangential component of along the curve. The positive direction of a curve is counterclockwise.   For the vector field below, the line integral around the circle is zero because the contribution of the negative tangential components from the upper part of the circle is the same as the contribution of the positive tangential components from the lower part.   The vector field below appears to take the form for some continuous functions and . As such, it is the gradiant of a function, and any integral around a closed loop is zero.   In the vector field below, the vector field is orthogonal to the unit tangent vector at each point, hence the line integral is zero.          Let C be the counter-clockwise planar circle with center at the origin and radius r 0. Without computing them, determine for the following vector fields whether the line integrals are positive, negative, or zero and type P, N, or Z as appropriate.  A. = the radial vector field = :  B. = the circulating vector field = :  C. = the circulating vector field = :  D. = the constant vector field = :    z    p    n    z         Consider the vector field shown in the figure below together with the paths , , and .   ( Note: For the vector field, vectors are shown with a dot at the tail of the vector.)  Arrange the line integrals , and in ascending order:    integral on C1    integral on C2    integral on C3       integral on C1    integral on C2    integral on C3       integral on C1    integral on C2    integral on C3   .                  , because the curve moves from left to right, in the same direction as the vector field.

  "body": " Using Parametrizations to Calculate Line Integrals     How can we use a parametrization of an oriented curve to calculate ?    How does the parametrization chosen for an oriented curve affect the value of the line integral ?    Under what conditions will changing the path taken from to change the the value of the line integral?       We begin this section by taking a look at how to calculate a line integral of a vector field along different line segments. We will use this calculation as inspiration to see how treating oriented curves as vector-valued functions will allow us to quickly turn a line integral of a vector field into a single variable integral.    Let , let be the line segment from to , let be the line segment from to , and let be the line segment from to . Also let . This vector field and the curves are shown in .   A vector field and three oriented curves   The vector field plotted for and . This vector field radiates from the origin with vector length increasing as distance from the origin increases. The graph includes the line segment from to , the line segment from to , and the line segment from to .       Every point along has . Therefore, along , the vector field can be viewed purely as a function of . In particular, along , we have . Since every point along has the same -value, write as a function of only (for the points on ).    along .    along .    Recall that , and along , we have that . Thus, . We know that along , .

Thus, we have .    Use the previous parts and a property of line integrals to calculate without having to evaluate any additional integrals.        Parametrizations in the Definition of  In , you saw how line integrals along vertical and horizontal line segments can be done as integrals of a single variable. Before moving on to the general case, let us consider in the next example how we might tackle in .   Since is from to , we can determine that the line segment has slope , so we can write an equation for the line as or . Thus, along the curve , we can write . Thinking of the slope of as , we can write , which can be rearranged to . We may view as . Since and , we use the fact that to write . Along , we have , so having rewritten in terms of and in terms of , we can now write . Notice that this result is different than what you obtained for in , even though and both start at and end at .   A recurring theme in this chapter will be the consideration of whether or not a vector field is a gradient vector field. Before moving on to generalize to curves that are not line segments, it is worth examining this question for the vector field we have been investigating.    Is a gradient vector field? Why or why not?    What would tell you about a potential function such that ?    No.    The vector field is not a gradient vector field because there is no scalar-valued function of two variables such that and . According to Clairaut's Theorem, if such a function existed, then , but .     and have shown us that it is possible to evaluate line integrals without needing to work with Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line segments. It was not critical that the paths in were straight lines, but rather that the paths had a description where both and could be expressed in terms of one variable. Fortunately, parametrizing the oriented curve along which a line integral is calculated provides exactly the tool we are looking for. Namely a parameterization gives a way to express the points of the oriented curve in terms of a single variable (the parameter). Note that given a parameterization, we can also translate the vector field component equations into functions of the parameter as well.   In this example, we will look at the particulars of applying a parameterization of (given by with ) to . In particular, we will use this parameterization and a set of points along that are equally spaced in terms of parameter values. To make this discussion a bit easier to read, we will work with a curve in two dimensions. However, all the ideas here generalize directly to curves in .  Suppose that is an oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function for , and let be a continuous vector field defined on a region containing . We can divide the interval into sub-intervals, each of length , by letting for . Dividing the interval into pieces using then can be used to break up into pieces by letting be the part of the curve from to for .   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces evenly spaced in terms of the paramter   An oriented curve from a point to a point broken into pieces     We can approximate the path with the displacement vector as we did in . Now notice that .   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces evenly spaced in terms of the paramter with displacement vectors   An oriented curve from a point to a point along with vectors that approximate the curve     Our vector field for can also be transformed into a function of by substituting the and inputs with the corresponding components of the parameterization. If , then the parameterization given by means we can rewrite as a function of :   We can now substitute these pieces into to obtain the following When evaluating the limit as , the expression in the parentheses will be . We then have a Riemann sum that changes the evaluation of a line integral of a vector field along an oriented curve to a definite integral of a function of one variable. In particular, Note that after evaluating the dot product, is (scalar) function of .   We now state the general form of the preceding example as a theorem that will allow us to evaluate line integrals of vector fields in many contexts.    Let be a smooth, oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function for . If is a continuous vector field defined near , then .    To illustrate how useful is for evaluating line integrals, consider the following example.    Let and let be the quarter of the circle of radius from to . This vector field and curve are shown in . By properties of line integrals, we know that , and we will use this property since is the usual clockwise orientation of a circle, meaning we can parametrize by for .   The vector field and an oriented curve    The region in the -plane with and . The quarter circle of radius centered at the origin and oriented clockwise is shown along with the vector field , which contains vectors whose magnitudes increase more as increases than as increases. Also vectors farther from the -axis have steeper positive slope than those close to the -axis, which are close to horiznotal.     To evaluate using this parametrization, we need to note that   Thus, we have . Note that we have used the substitution in evaluating the definite integral here.    As shows, allows us to reduce the problem of calculating a line integral of a vector-valued function along an oriented curve to one of finding a suitable parametrization for the curve. Once we have such a parametrization, evaluating the line integral becomes evaluating a single-variable integral, which is something you have done many times before. The example also illustrates that using the properties of line integrals can allow us to use a more natural parametrization. You may find it interesting to use the parametrization for to evaluate the line integral. Do you get the same result?    Find the work done by the vector field on a particle that moves from the point to the point along the helix given by .     for , so , so and   Let . Let be the closed curve consisting of the top half of the circle of radius centered at the origin and the portion of the -axis from to , oriented clockwise. Find the circulation of around .   Let be given by where . This means that and .  Let be given by where . This means that and .  Thus the line integral over then will give a result of .     will have you look at line integrals of the same vector field over several different types of curves. This will be an important, recurring theme as we study a variety of different integrals and vector fields in this chapter. In particular, we will use this approach of varying the region of integration for a fixed function several times in later activities.    Let .    Let be the portion of the graph of from to . Calculate .   If and the curve is traced out by for , then   Let be the line segment from to . Calculate .  In this part, the curve is traced out by for . So     Let be the circle of radius centered at the origin, oriented counterclockwise. Calculate .   In this part, the curve is traced out by as . So     To connect the previous parts of this activity, use a graphing utility to plot the curves and on the same axes.   What type of curve is ?   Closed   Since the curves have the same endpoints but is oriented oppositely, forms a closed curve.   What is the value of ?     Since , we have that .   What does your answer to part allow you to say about the value of the line integral of along the top half of compared to the line integral of from to along the bottom half of the circle of radius centered at the origin?  They are equal.  If we reverse the orientation of the bottom half, these curves combine to form . Thus, the sum of the two line integrals is , and so when changing the orientation of the bottom portion of the circle, we get that the line integrals are equal.      Alternative Notation for Line Integrals  In contexts where the fact that the quantity we are measuring via a line integral is best measured via a dot product (such as calculating work), the notation we have used thus far for line integrals is fairly common. However, sometimes the vector field is such that the units on , , and are not distances. In this case, a dot product may not have quite the same physical meaning, and an alternative notation using differentials can be common. Specifically, if , then . A line integral in the form of is called the differential form of a line integral line integral differential form of . (If is a vector field in , the term is omitted.) For example, if and is some oriented curve in , then   It is important to recognize that the integral on the right-hand side is still a line integral and must be evaluated using techniques for evaluating line integrals. We cannot simply try to treat the line integral of the form as if it were a definite integral of a function of one variable. Because the notation provides a reminder that this is a line integral and not a definite integral of the types calculated earlier in your study of calculus, we will only use the vector notation for line integrals in the body of the text. However, some exercises may require the use of the differential form, and you may see the differential form used frequently in fields such as physics and engineering.    Independence of Parametrization for a Fixed Curve  Up to this point, we have chosen whatever parametrization of an oriented curve was most convienent, and our argument for how we can use parametrizations to calculate line integrals did not depend on the specific choice of parametrization. However, it is not immediately obvious that different parametrizations don't result in different values of the line integral. Our next example explores this question.   Let . We consider two different oriented curves from to . The first oriented curve travels horizontally to and then proceeds vertically to . The second oriented curve is the line segment from to . Notice that, as depicted in , we can break up into two oriented curves (the horizontal portion) and (the vertical portion) so that .   The vector field and some oriented curves.   The vector field , which consists of horiznotal vectors that increase in length as distance from the -axis increases. Three oriented line segments are also depicted. The line segment is from to . The line segment is from to . The line segment is from to .     We first note that since is orthogonal to , ; therefore . We can parametrize as for ( is treated like the coordinate ), which leads to .  Thus, .  Now we look at , but we parametrize in a nonstandard way by letting for . (You should use a graphing utility to plot this parametrization to help convince yourself that it really does give .) This gives , and .  In the next activity, you are asked to consider the more typical parametrization of and verify that using it gives the same value for the line integral.  It's also worth observing here that , so at least two (very different) paths from to give the same value of the line integral here. The next section will further investigate when line integrals over different paths (with the same initial point and final point) will evaluate to the same value.   As promised, the final activity of this section ( ) asks you to look at another parametrization of the curve from the previous example. It also asks you to look at two different oriented curves between a pair of points, similarly to what you did in .    The typical parametrization of the line segment from to (the oriented curve in ) is where . Use this parametrization to calculate for the vector field and compare your answer to the result of .   Using the parametrization given the line integral becomes This is the same result as in .    Calculate where is the oriented curve consisting of the line segment from the origin to followed by the line segment from to .   Let where and where . Our line integral can be computed with  Thus the line integral over then is     Calculate where is the line segment from to .   The line segment from to can be given by with . Note that , so     Is the vector field you considered in the previous two parts a gradient vector field? Why or why not? How does this compare to the vector field of ?  No  No. One way to observe this would be to check the partial derivative with respect to of the component and compare it to the partial derivative with respect to of the component. Since they are not equal, tells us that this vector field is not a gradient vector field.    Although we have not given a proof or even an intuitive argument, the phenomenon you observed in part of is not particular to this curve or this vector field. The value of does not depend on the parametrization of used to calculate the line integral when using .     Summary     Line integrals of vector fields along oriented curves can be evaluated by parametrizing the curve in terms of and then calculating the integral of on the interval .    The parametrization chosen for an oriented curve when calculating the line integral using the formula does not impact the value of the line integral.    If and are different paths from to , it is possible for to have a different value to .          Suppose and is the portion of the ellipse centered at the origin from the point to the point centered at the origin oriented clockwise.  (a) Find a vector parametric equation for the portion of the ellipse described above for .    (b) Using your parametrization in part (a), set up an integral for calculating the circulation of around .     with limits of integration  and   (c) Find the circulation of around .  Circulation =                                  Evaluate the line integral , where and C is given by the vector function              Evaluate the line integral where and is the path given by for             The line integral is then:          Compute when and is the line segment from to .     The line segment can be given by as , which means that . Thus,    Compute when and is the line segment from to .     This is the same integral as the previous part with the orientation flipped, so     If the wind in a region of space is given by and a helicopter flies along the path given by as . Calculate the work done by the wind on the helicopter.   Set up your integral carefully and then use either integration by parts or an algebraic solver to compute the definite integral.    The vector field is along the path given (which we will call ) and . So,     Let be the circle of radius centered at the origin traveled counterclockwise. Compute when:  We will parametrize by as . So,    We will parametrize by as . So, .    We will parametrize by as . So, .    Let be the curve given by traveling along the path given by on the surface given by as goes from to .

What special properties do gradient vector fields have?    Given a gradient vector field , how can we efficiently find a potential function so that ?      In , , and , we encountered situations where and are different oriented curves from a point to a point and . In this section, we explore vector fields which have the property that for all points and , if and are oriented paths from to , then .

The line segment is given by as . Thus, Note here that which is the same as the result of the line integral.      Path-Independent Vector Fields  Hopefully has prompted you to wonder about the phenomenon of the value of a line integral depending only on the initial and terminal points of the oriented path (rather than the oriented path itself) and how a potential function comes into play. We say that a vector field defined on a region is path-independent path-independent definition if whenever and are oriented paths in such that both curves start at point and end at point .  In and , we encountered situations where we had evidence that a vector field was path-independent. However, since the definition of path-independence requires that the value of the line integral be the same for every possible path from one point to the other (regardless of choice for the initial and final points), it doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent is an easy task.  Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be shown to be path-independent. Let be a function for which is continuous on a region . Suppose that and are points in and let be a smooth oriented path from to that is also contained in our region . We consider by fixing an arbitrary parametrization of , . Since we can write , , and in terms of , along , the gradient of is given by . Hence, we can write the line integral of the vector field over in the following way:   If , then the integrand above is . Or more simply, .  Notice that this is exactly what the chain rule tells us is equal to. Therefore, we may apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to obtain .  In other words, gradient vector fields are path-independent vector fields, and we can evaluate line integrals of gradient vector fields by using a potential function.   Technically the argument above assumed that was smooth, but we can replace by a piecewise smooth curve by splitting the line integral up into the sum of finitely many line integrals along smooth curves.   This result is so important that it is frequently called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, because of its similarity to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , which can be written as .   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals   Let be a function for which is continuous on a region . If and are points in and is a piecewise smooth oriented path from to in , then .     Suppose we need to calculate the line integral of over the path from to along the curve given by . If we use to solve this, we would need to parameterize the curve, take a derivative of the parameterization, substitute into the line integral formula, and finally integrate the result. Fortunately, allows us to be more efficient in how we approach this. In order to use , we first need to verify that there exists a potential function such that . We will soon learn techniques in for finding a protential function, but for now, you should be able to verify for yourself that will be of the form , where is a constant. Note that , regardless of what value we choose for . By ,  If we changed the path in our line integral to be any other path between and , then the result would still be .  If we changed the path in our line integral to be some path from to but did not change the vector field being used, then we would only need to evaluate . So for our new path , .   Sometimes, we know that the vector field we need to compute a line integral in is the gradient vector field of a given function, in which case evaluation of the line integral is very efficient. Before investigating how to find a potential function, we have an activity to practice applying when we are given the potential function.    Calculate each of the following line integrals.     if and is the top half of the unit circle oriented from to .  Because and , then .    if and is the portion of the helix from to .  Because and , then .     if and is the curve consisting of the line segment from to , followed by the line segment from to , followed by the line segment from to .  Because and , then .   In , we used to argue that a vector field in is not a gradient vector field when . In , you verified that a given vector field was the gradient of a particular function of two variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of three variables. However, in that case there are six mixed partials to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious. suggest a process for determining if a vector field in is a gradient vector field as well as finding a potential function for the vector field.    Let and .    If and are to be gradient vector fields, then there are functions and for which and . If such functions and exist, what would , , , , and be?  , , , , , and .  Each of the partial derivatives of and would have to be as follows: , , , , , and .    Let . Calculate . Could be a potential function for the vector field ?  . No. The partial of with respect to would be . Since the partial of with respect to is not the same as the -component of , cannot be a potential function for .    Find a function so that . Find a function so that .   and     and but can be different by any function of and .    When finding the most general anti-derivative for a function of one variable, we add a constant of integration (usually denoted by ) to capture the fact that any constant will become through differentiation.   When taking the partial derivative with respect to of a function of , , and , what variables can appear in terms that become in the partial derivative because they are treated as constants?  and  Any terms that do not contain an -variable will be treated as a constant, so and are allowed.   What does this tell you should be added to and in the previous part to make them the most general possible functions with the desired partial derivatives with respect to ?  and  The most general form of and are and , where and are functions.    Now calculate and based on your choices for . Write a few sentences to explain why this tells you that we must have and for some functions and depending only on .  , . We find that and . This means that we need to add terms to and in and such that the partial with respect to will correspond to the second component of and .   Calculate and for the functions in the part above.

By following the methodology laid out in to show that a given vector field is a gradient vector field, the makes evaluating some line integrals much simpler now.

We can choose and note that . By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, .     Line Integrals Along Closed Curves  Recall that an oriented curve is closed if the curve has the same initial and terminal point. A typical example of a closed curve would be a circle (with an orientation of which way to go around), but we could also consider something like the square with vertices , , , and , oriented clockwise (or counterclockwise). Recall that we sometimes use the symbol for a line integral when the curve is closed and that if , then .    Suppose that is a continuous path-independent vector field (in or ) on some region .    Let and be points in and let and be oriented curves from to . What can you say about and ?  . Because is a path-independent vector field and both and start at and end at , .   Let . Explain why is a closed curve.   starts and ends at .   The curve is closed because the end of is the start of and the end of is the start of , thus starts and ends at .    Calculate .  and by , this difference is zero.   Write a sentence that summarizes what we can conclude about line integrals of at this point in the activity.   The line integral along every closed curve in a path-independent vector field is .    Now let us suppose that is a continuous vector field on a region for which for all closed curves . Pick two points and in . Let and be oriented curves from to . What type of curve is ?  Closed We have that is a closed curve (from to ) because will go from to and will go from back to .   What is ? Why?  We see that because (as stated above) is a continuous vector field on a region for which for all closed curves .   What does that tell you about the relationship between and ?  Since , .   Explain why this shows that is path-independent.  Arbitrary paths with common initial and terminal points were used. The argument above relies only on the fact that the two paths have the same initial and terminal points.   We summarize the result of with the theorem below. Although this theorem is not a terribly useful way to show that a vector field is path-independent, it can be a useful way to show that a vector field is not path-independent: If you can find a closed curve around which the circulation is not zero, then the vector field is not path independent.    Let be a continuous vector field on a region . Suppose that is a closed curve in . The circulation of along , given by , is zero if and only if is path-independent.    The following activity gives you a chance to reason about path-independence based purely on a graphical representation of a vector field.    Explain why neither of the vector fields in is path-independent.   Two vector fields that are not path-independent.      A vector field in which all vectors are horizontal. The vectors are along the -axis, point to the right for and point to the left for . Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases.        A vector field in which vectors appear to circulate in a clockwise manner around the point . The magnitude of vectors increases with the distance from . The plot shows the portion of the vector field with and .         For , consider a square with lower-left corner and upper-right corner . For , consider a circle centered at .    In , we consider the square with lower-left corner and upper-right corner , oriented clockwise, to be . Notice that because the line integrals along the horizontal edges of the square are both positive and the line integrals along the vertical sides are zero because is orthogonal to those sides. Because the line integral along this closed curve is not , is not path-independent.  In , consider the circle of radius centered at the point . It appears that is tangent to , but we can confidently say that along , which makes , and thus is not path-independent.      What other vector fields are path-independent?  Recall that in single variable calculus, The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that given a constant and a continuous function , there is a unique function for which and . In particular, is this function. We are about to investigate an analog of this result for path-independent vector fields, but first we require two additional definitions.  If is a subset of or , we say that is open  open definition provided that for every point in , there is a disc (in ) or ball (in ) centered at that point such that every point of the disc\/ball is contained in . For example, the set of points in for which is open, since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc contained in the set (as illustrated by point in ). However, if we change the inequality to , then the set is not open, as any point on the circle cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside the set, that is with (as illustrated by the point in ). We will also say that a region is path-connected path-connected definition provided that for every pair of points in , there is a path from one to the other contained in .   The open set is plotted in yellow with a point on the boundary that shows why is not open   The open set is plotted in yellow with a point       Let be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, path-connected region . We will assume that is in and is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to . We want to define a function on by using the vector field and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign an arbitrary value. (Setting is probably convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point in , define , where is any oriented path from to . Since is path-connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since is path-independent, is well-defined. If different paths from to gave different values for the line integral, then we would not be sure what really is.  To better understand this mysterious function we've now defined, let's start looking at its partial derivatives.    Since is open, there is a disc (perhaps very small) surrounding that is contained in , so fix a point in that disc. Since is path-connected, there is a path from to . Let be the line segment from to and let be the line segment from to . (See Figure .) Rewrite as a sum of and line integrals along , , and .   A piecewise smooth oriented curve from to .   An oriented curve from to . It begins with a curved arc from to and then proceeds vertically from to and then horizontally to .      Because , we have that .   Notice that we can parametrize by for . Find a similar parametrization for .   for The curve can be given by for , since only the -coordinate of points on varies.   Use the parametrization from above to write and as single variable integrals in the manner of . Use the fact that to express your integrals in terms of and without any dot products.   and   Using the parametrization of and from the previous part, we notice that has only one nonzero component in each case. Thus, we have and .    Rewrite your expression for using a line integral along and the single variable integrals above.      Combining the previous parts, we have .    Notice that your expression for from the previous part only depends on as the upper limit of an single variable integral. Use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to calculate .   The first three terms in our expression for do not depend on , and thus when taking the partial derivative with respect to , they vanish. By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (treating as constants), . Therefore, .    To calculate , we continue to consider a path from to , but now let be the line segment from to and let be the line segment from to . Modify the process you used to find to find .    An oriented curve from to . It begins with a curved arc from to . It then proceeds horizontally from to and then vertically to .    Proceeding as above, we find that . Only the last term of this expression depends on , so the first three terms vanish when calculating . By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, . Therefore, .    What can you conclude about the relationship between and ? What does this tell you about beyond that it is path-independent and continuous?  ; is a gradient vector field  Since and , we can conclude that . Therefore, we know that is a gradient vector field.    We summarize the result of below. Much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which tells us that a function is an antiderivative for another function, but leaves the antiderivative in terms of a definite integral, this theorem tells us that a function is a potential function for a vector field, but the definnition of the potential function is in terms of a line integral.   Path-Independent Vector Fields   If is a path-independent vector field on an open, path-connected region , then is a gradient vector field on . Furthermore, if is a point in and is fixed, then for a point in and an oriented curve from to in , the function is a potential function for .      Summary     Gradient vector fields are path-independent, and if is an oriented curve from to , then with the analogous result holding if is a function of three variables.    A vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is .    If a vector field is path-independent, then there exists a function such that . That is, is a conservative or gradient vector field.         Let . Find the change in between and in two ways.  (a) First, find the change by computing the line integral , where is a curve connecting and .  The simplest curve is the line segment joining these points. Parameterize it:  with ,    So that    Note that this isn't a very pleasant integral to evaluate by hand (though we could easily find a numerical estimate for it).

Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section is long, but important. To do all the activities, you will need multpile 50-minute class periods. One way to facilitate this would be to treat as if it were a preview activity and have students work on it before the second class meeting. You could also opt to de-emphasize finding potential functions and omit that activity.   is also rather long. We have arranged the subsection by placing after the activity so as to not spoil the discovery to which the activity builds. This activity can be skipped without adversely impacting the remainder of the chapter. However, if choosing to omit , you may wish to specifically point out the culminating theorem to students.   "

In particular, the line integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is along the path (in the direction of travel.) shows how to use a Riemann sum to measure the accumulation of the vector field in the direction of travel along the given curve. Additionally, shows how the line integral can be efficently calculated in terms of the vector field and the derivative of any paramaterization of . Philosophically, the Riemann sum in is adding up the scalar function given by the dot product of the vector field and the unit vector in the direction of travel (along the curve).  We will devote the rest of this section to answering these questions about generalizing the ideas of line integrals as fully as possible.    How can we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a curve in space?  What would that accumulation measure physically?  What is the most efficent way to calculate this accumulation?      In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amount of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine. The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.   A plot of land with density of copium deposits        Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from driving along the left side of plot. You should write a few sentences about how you got your estimate based on the copium density and length of the path. (Did you use more than one piece?)   Answers will vary but would likely be around 1200   Answers will vary but the calculuation should be done by multipling the density at some point(s) along the side by the length of the side. For instance, you might estimate the density to be about 2.5 on the left side of the plot and length to be about 500, so this would give an estimated 1250 in Copium mined along the left side of the plot.    Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined by driving along the entire outer edge of the plot. You should write a few sentences about how you got your estimate based on the copium density and length of the paths.

Doing this type of estimation around each side will give an estimate around 3000.    Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from the scraping the curved path shown below. You should use at least 3 segments in your estimate. You should write a few sentences about how you got your estimate based on the copium density and length of the paths.

For instance, you might estimate the lengths and density using a linear approximation of the left side, the top, and the right side separately. You could estimate the left side to have a length of 150 and density of 2.5, the top to have a length of 100 and density of 1.5, and the right side to have a length of 100 and density of 1. This would give an estimate of 625 Copium mined.    Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from the scraping the curved path shown below. You should use at least 3 segments in your estimate. You should also explain how and why your answer to this question is different or similar to the previous task.   A plot of land with copium density and a path plotted in blue       Answers will vary but likely to be around 600   Answers will vary but likely to be around 600. The difference with the last problem is the direction traveled, which would not change any of the estimations of length or density. In other words, the direction of travel does not affect the result of these estimates.      Defining line integrals of scalar functions  In , you approximated the distance traveled for various paths and multiplied by the density of the copium on each piece of the path. In contrast to the line integral of a vector field, the calculations of the ore mined does not depend on what direction the path was traveled. We will now use these same ideas to give precise meaning to the measurement of the acculumation of a scalar function's output over a path in space.  Let be a contiunuous function of , , and for some open set around , a curve from a point to a point . We will begin to approximate the acculumlation of the output of over by breaking into pieces with boundary points . The curve is the part of that goes from to and is the displacement vector from to    A curve in space with segments given by      We can approximate the accumulation of over with the following sum , where is the output of for some . As this sum uses more pieces and all of the lengths of the pieces goes to zero (i.e. ), we would expect that the sum will approach the actual acculumation of over . Notice that it won't matter how we select the point that is used in each piece to evaluate the output of since evaluating the limit as the length of gets smaller will ensure that the output value choosen will be within a shrinking error from the average value on each piece. Evaluating the limit of the sum above as the size of all of the pieces goes to zero will transform our Riemann sum into an integral that will measure the accumulation of the output of over .   The Line Integral of a Scalar Function   Let be a curve from a point to a point in space. Let be a contiunuous function of , , and for some open set around . The line integral of over is defined as where are points such that and as the distance between and goes to zero.  The integral is called the scalar line integral of over the curve .    The notation for a scalar line integral ( ) may not immediately make sense. As with the other types of integration we have done (single variable integration, double integrals, line integrals of vector fields, etc.), the subscript of the integral symbol denotes the region of integration. In the case of a scalar line integral, the region of integration is a collection of points given by a curve in space. The function we are integrating is , a scalar-valued functiton of multiple variables. The differential may seem unusual to you. If you remember from , is the arc length of a curve in space. So the differential in the scalar line integral notation means that we are adding up the output of over steps in arc length. This should make sense in terms of how we set up our Riemann sums. We did not set up the pieces of our curve as steps in , , or , but rather as steps in arc length (estimated by ). This may feel similar to situations such as double integrals, where we generically used for the differential, but the different contexts called for different values of . For instance, in polar coordinates, we use     Before getting into the details of computing line integrals of scalar functions, we will first make arguments about when the line integral of a scalar function is positive, negative, or zero. For all of this example, we will use the curve given by for . We also will define the following three scalar-valued functions on .        The curve used in the line integral for       For our first case, we will consider the line integral . Remember that the line integral of over will measure the accumulation of the output of over the points on the curve . shows that the blue branch of the curve (for ) will yield positive output values for , while the magenta part, which has , will produce negative output values for . Intuitively, there is more of the curve with positive outputs than negative outputs, so we would expect to be positive. However, the magnitude of the -values produced must also be accounted for.  The curve split into regions with positive (blue) and negative (magenta) outputs of     If we break our curve into three pieces by dividing at and as shown in , we can make a rigourous argument about why the result of will be positive. We will call the magenta, green, and blue sections of  , , and , respectively. Using the notation of , we have . No matter how we break up the curve to set up a Riemann sum used in we can do the symmetric version on curve . The only difference between the Riemann sums and thier associated line integrals for and will be the sign on the output of . This means that and thus .  The curve split into three regions with positive (blue and green) and negative (magenta) outputs of     The argument for why requires that both the points on the curves and and the output of on those parts is symmetric. In you will see examples where having only one part of this symmetry is not sufficent to make this type of argument. We have shown that and want to demonstrate why will be positive. Because the output of is positive for all of the points on the curve , all elements of the associated Riemann sum in will be positive (the length of the displacement vectors and corresponding arc lengths are always positive). Thus .  We now want to consider whether will be positive, negative, or zero. This is a simpler argument than in the previous case because the output of will be negative for all points in (execept for the origin). Each term in the Riemann sum used to define the scalar line integral will be the product of a negative value ( ) and a positive value ( ). Therefore the Riemann sums will be negative and the limit as you take more terms in this sum will also be negative. Thus, .  Finally, we want to make an argument whether will be positive, negative, or zero. While we cannot lean on the intuitive nature of the where coordinates are positive or negative, we can make a very precise argument about the output of for the points on . While will have a range that includes all real numbers, the output of is always zero for the points on our curve because for points on , the -coordinate is equal to the -coordinate squared. This means that no matter how we break up our segments for the Riemann sum, the terms will always be zero. No matter how many terms are used the Reimann sum will be zero, and the limit of the Riemann sums will also be zero. Thus, .   Before delving into the exact computation of line integrals of scalar-valued functions, here is an activity that allows you to practice arguments similar to .    In this activity, we will be making sense of scalar line integrals by examining a few common functions and justifying whether the scalar line integrals given are positive, negative, or zero.

Using Parameterizations to Calculate Scalar Line Integrals   defined in terms of a limit of a Riemann sum which is often useful for understanding what is being measured and not very useful when it comes to efficiently calculating the value of a given integral. A scalar line integral is presented algebraically in terms of three variables because the curve is given in terms of points in three coordinates and the function to be integrated is dependent on those same coordinate values. Geometrically, the scalar line integral is a one dimensional problem because we only have one dimension to travel; namely, we can travel along the curve in steps of arc length. Remember that a parameterization of a curve in space is a description of how to travel through the points (given as three coordinates) of the curve in terms of a parameter (usually given as .) Parameterizations are very useful converting the three-variable algebra of a scalar line integral problem into a one dimensional integral. Once we have done that, we can use all of the tools of single-variable calculus to evaluate the scalar line integral.  Let's look at applying a parameterization for given by a vector-valued function of one variable for in some interval to . Instead of thinking in terms of pieces of the curve , the parameterization allows us to break the interval into pieces where and . While these pieces will be equally spaced in terms of the parameter , the corresponding points on the curve given by may not be equally spaced.   The curve split into segments defined by equally spaced parameter values      To simplify the notation of our function evaluation, we will use the following: where . Remember that the parameterization will allow us to write all parts of the scalar line integral as a function of , so we will simplify as Applying our parameterization and corresponding points to gives . This Riemann sum correponds to the definite integral of a scalar function of , specifically where . We may think of is the speed of the parameterization .   Calculating Scalar Line Integrals with Parameterizations  Let be a curve in space parameterized by for . If is a multivariable function that is continuous for a region around , then .   With established, we now consider a couple of examples that allow us to find the exact value of line integrals of scalar functions considered in .   Let us return to some of the problems from . Specifically, let be part of the unit circle on the -plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by . We will also consider . We can parameterize by with . Note here that . We can rewrite the value of along using the parameterization as . Applying , we have .  This result should make sense from your earlier work in . Specifically, we can break the line integral of along into three parts according to the plot shown in .   A subdivided plot of      The scalar line integal on the blue and the magenta paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric about -axis and the output of will be opposite in sign on the blue and magenta portions. This means that will be the same as the line integral of on the green path. Since the output of is positive on the green path, our result for the scalar line integral should be positive.   When working through , you may have found the line integrals involving to be more challenging to reason through without computational tools. We next work through the details of evaluating the line integral of this function along the same curve as in the previous example.   Let be part of the unit circle on the -plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by . We will also consider . We can parameterize by with . Note here that . We can write the value of along using the parameterization as . Applying , we have   This result should make sense from your earlier work in part . Specifically, we can break the line integral of into two parts according to the plot in .   A subdivided plot of      The scalar line integal on the blue and the magenta paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric and the output of will be opposite in sign on the blue and magenta. Thus the line integral of over will be zero.     In this activity, we will examine why we must be careful when using symmetry to make arguments about scalar line integral. Let and be the paths shown in . We will consider the function for this activity.   A plot of paths and        Parameterize and as and . (It is fine to have for both of your parameterizations.)    ,    We parameterize with and parameterize with . Both parameterizations use parameter values in the interval . These are not the only ways to parameterize these segments.    Use to compute and .    and    We can calculate and . Thus we can evaluate our scalar line integral as     As with line integrals of vector fields, we have that . Use this property to compute .       We can evaluate our scalar line integral as In the calculation above, you can see how the difference in displacements manifests differently in the two integrals (as and ) which makes the final result not quite cancel out to zero.    In , it may have been tempting to note that output of the function being integrated is simply the -coordinate of the points on the curve to try to make an argument by symmetry. Since we are adding up the -values of the points on and and the -coordinates on go from to and the -coordinates on go from to , you may have wanted to argue that the values of and will cancel out to zero. However, as you found, this is not correct because the scalar line integrals are not just adding up the output of our scalar function. The Riemann sum used in the scalar line integral is adding up the product of the scalar function's output with the displacement of the segment used. Because the displacement used in and will not be symmetric, we cannot make the geometric cancelation argument as in part .    Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation from . If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar in definite integrals.   Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , scalar valued functions and , and oriented curves , , and , the following properties hold:                         The biggest difference bewteen and is part . The orientation of the curve does not change the value of the scalar line integral. will have you make sense of these properties for scalar line integrals.   Explaining Properties of Scalar Line Integrals   In this activity, we will be explaining each of the Properties from in the context of our copium mining analogy from . Remember that the curve in our scalar line integral coresponds to the path the mining rig will take and the function in the scalar line integral measures the density of copium at that point on the surface.    Explain in your own words what means in the copium analogy and what exactly would be measured by this scalar line integral.   The scalar line integral would calculate the accumulation of copium mined along the path given by where gives the density of copium at each location in the area. In particular, measures the total copium mined along the path .   The scalar line integral would calculate the accumulation of copium mined along the path given by where gives the density of copium at each location in the area. In particular, measures the total copium mined along the path .    Explain in your own words what means in the copium analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   The scalar line integral would calculate the accumulation of copium mined along the path given by where gives the density of copium at each location in the area. If we have -times the density of copium as before (the left side of our equation), the total amount of mined Copium will be -times as much (the right side of the equation).   The scalar line integral would calculate the accumulation of copium mined along the path given by where gives the density of copium at each location in the area. If we have -times the density of copium as before (the left side of our equation), the total amount of mined Copium will be -times as much (the right side of the equation).    Explain in your own words what means in the copium analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   If is the density of mineral 1 and is the density of mineral 2, then the total amount of minerals that is harvested (the left side of the equation) will be the sum of the amount harvested for minearl 1 and mineral 2 (the right side of the equation).   If is the density of mineral 1 and is the density of mineral 2, then the total amount of minerals that is harvested (the left side of the equation) will be the sum of the amount harvested for minearl 1 and mineral 2 (the right side of the equation).    Explain in your own words what means in the copium analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   The amount of Copium that is harvested does not depend on the direction of the path taken. The amount of Copium harvested would be the same if you drove a path from point A to point B as if you took the same path from point B to point A.   The amount of Copium that is harvested does not depend on the direction of the path taken. The amount of Copium harvested would be the same if you drove a path from point A to point B as if you took the same path from point B to point A.    Explain in your own words what means in the copium analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   The amount of Copium mined from taking the path given by then will be the same as the amount of Copium mined on plus the amount of Copium mined on the path .   The amount of Copium mined from taking the path given by then will be the same as the amount of Copium mined on plus the amount of Copium mined on the path .      Visualizations of Scalar Line Integrals as Area Under a Curve  We will spend the last part of this section talking about a way to try to visualize the scalar line integral as an area under a curve, much as we visualized integrals when we first encountered them. Let's return to our copium analogy from . In particular, we can look the left side of the mining area.   A plot of land with density of copium deposits      We could visualize the linear density of copium along the left side of the area using a plot like .   A plot of the copium density on the left side of the mine shown above      In , the horizontal axis gives the distance traveled along the left side of . Because this is a stright path, we could plot the density above the path of the copium mining plot. In fact, we could plot the density above the plot for all of the sides of the mining plot.   A three-dimensional plot of the copium Density plotted for the edges of the mining area     shows the copium mine plot (in gray) and the paths that are the boundary of the plot in magenta. The curve in green shows the copium Density at each point on the boundary of the mine plot. The area in yellow would be the scalar line integral for the path that is the boundary of the mine plot. In particular, the area in yellow would give the total copium mined from driving our mining machine around the boundary of the mine plot.  Because the curve we are looking at in involves straight lines and simple heights, there is no confusion when looking at this plot and using an area under the curve analogy. However, what if we looked at the scalar line integral of a function like along the helix given below?   A three-dimensional plot of a helix    Suppose now that above the points of our green helix we try to plot a second blue curve where the position of the point on the blue curve is units above or below the position of the point on the helix. This would be the analogous idea to what we did in , but for a three-dimensional curve. Here we run into issues, however, as our area might intersect other parts of the curve. The plot below shows the confusing plot we would have if we looked at as the height above our curve in blue.   A three-dimensional plot of a helix with height given by      Summary     The scalar line integral, denoted by , measures the acculumation of the output of over the points on the curve .    Parameterizing the curve used in a scalar line integral allows you to compute the scalar line integral as a definite integral of one variable.    Scalar line integrals can be split into pieces of the curve or along linear combinations of the scalar valued function being integrated.         Find the line integral with respect to arc length , where is the line segment in the -plane with endpoints and .  (a) Find a vector parametric equation for the line segment so that points and correspond to and , respectively.    (b) Using the parametrization in part (a), the line integral with respect to arc length is     with limits of integration  and   (c) Evaluate the line integral with respect to arc length in part (b).

Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amount of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine.

A plot of land with density of copium deposits        Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from driving along the left side of plot. You should write a few sentences about how you got your estimate based on the copium density and length of the path. (Did you use more than one piece?)   Answers will vary but would likely be around 1200   Answers will vary but the calculuation should be done by multipling the density at some point(s) along the side by the length of the side. For instance, you might estimate the density to be about 2.5 on the left side of the plot and length to be about 500, so this would give an estimated 1250 in Copium mined along the left side of the plot.    Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined by driving along the entire outer edge of the plot. You should write a few sentences about how you got your estimate based on the copium density and length of the paths.   Answers will vary but would likely be around 3000   Answers will vary but the calculuation should be done by multipling the density at some point(s) along the side by the length of the side. For instance, you might estimate the density to be about 2.5 on the left side of the plot and length to be about 500, so this would give an estimated 1250 in Copium mined along the left side of the plot. Doing this type of estimation around each side will give an estimate around 3000.    Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from the scraping the curved path shown below. You should use at least 3 segments in your estimate. You should write a few sentences about how you got your estimate based on the copium density and length of the paths.

For instance, you might estimate the lengths and density using a linear approximation of the left side, the top, and the right side separately. You could estimate the left side to have a length of 150 and density of 2.5, the top to have a length of 100 and density of 1.5, and the right side to have a length of 100 and density of 1. This would give an estimate of 625 Copium mined.    Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from the scraping the curved path shown below. You should use at least 3 segments in your estimate. You should also explain how and why your answer to this question is different or similar to the previous task.

The difference with the last problem is the direction traveled, which would not change any of the estimations of length or density. In other words, the direction of travel does not affect the result of these estimates.   "

  "body": "  Before getting into the details of computing line integrals of scalar functions, we will first make arguments about when the line integral of a scalar function is positive, negative, or zero. For all of this example, we will use the curve given by for . We also will define the following three scalar-valued functions on .        The curve used in the line integral for       For our first case, we will consider the line integral . Remember that the line integral of over will measure the accumulation of the output of over the points on the curve . shows that the blue branch of the curve (for ) will yield positive output values for , while the magenta part, which has , will produce negative output values for . Intuitively, there is more of the curve with positive outputs than negative outputs, so we would expect to be positive. However, the magnitude of the -values produced must also be accounted for.  The curve split into regions with positive (blue) and negative (magenta) outputs of     If we break our curve into three pieces by dividing at and as shown in , we can make a rigourous argument about why the result of will be positive. We will call the magenta, green, and blue sections of  , , and , respectively. Using the notation of , we have . No matter how we break up the curve to set up a Riemann sum used in we can do the symmetric version on curve . The only difference between the Riemann sums and thier associated line integrals for and will be the sign on the output of . This means that and thus .  The curve split into three regions with positive (blue and green) and negative (magenta) outputs of     The argument for why requires that both the points on the curves and and the output of on those parts is symmetric. In you will see examples where having only one part of this symmetry is not sufficent to make this type of argument. We have shown that and want to demonstrate why will be positive. Because the output of is positive for all of the points on the curve , all elements of the associated Riemann sum in will be positive (the length of the displacement vectors and corresponding arc lengths are always positive). Thus .  We now want to consider whether will be positive, negative, or zero. This is a simpler argument than in the previous case because the output of will be negative for all points in (execept for the origin). Each term in the Riemann sum used to define the scalar line integral will be the product of a negative value ( ) and a positive value ( ). Therefore the Riemann sums will be negative and the limit as you take more terms in this sum will also be negative. Thus, .  Finally, we want to make an argument whether will be positive, negative, or zero. While we cannot lean on the intuitive nature of the where coordinates are positive or negative, we can make a very precise argument about the output of for the points on . While will have a range that includes all real numbers, the output of is always zero for the points on our curve because for points on , the -coordinate is equal to the -coordinate squared. This means that no matter how we break up our segments for the Riemann sum, the terms will always be zero. No matter how many terms are used the Reimann sum will be zero, and the limit of the Riemann sums will also be zero. Thus, .  "

  "body": " The Divergence of a Vector Field     How can you measure where a vector field's strength is increasing or decreasing?    What does the divergence of a vector field measure and how can you visually estimate whether the divergence of a vector field is positive or negative?      As we saw in , there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is Where exactly is the vector field created? With the vector field in , imagine sketching a curve that follows the direction of the vector field by treating the vectors in the vector field as tangent vectors to your curve. No matter where you start, you should observe that the vector field decreases in strength as you move along the flow. We wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.   A vector field with changing strength    A vector field with vectors shortest along the line and longer as distance from that line increases. Vectors in the fourth quadrant point primarily in the positive -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the second quadrant point primarily in the negative -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the first and third quadrants exhibit a form of counterclockwise rotation.        In this preview activity, we will look at several two-dimensional vector fields and try to assess when the vector field has increased or decreased in strength over a given region. We begin with graphs of the three vector fields, , , and . Parts , , and ask you to answer the same three questions about the vector field and square illustrated in each of the figures. Part asks you to think further about the third vector field.   Vector Field   A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin. The length of vectors increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .      Vector Field   A vector field with vectors below the -axis pointing primarily up near the axis and primarily to the right farther away from the axis. Above the -axis, vectors point primarily to the right. Vector magnitudes are shortest near the positive -axis. There is a square in the second quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .      Vector Field   A vector field in which vectors circulate around the origin as if tangent vectors to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled . There is a point labeled in the second quadrant that is the reflection of across the -axis. In the third quadrant, there is a point that is closer to the -axis than to the -axis. In the fourth quadrant, there is a point labeled that appears to be on the line but is farther from the origin than or .       For each of the vector fields , , and and the square centered on , , and (respectively), which statement do you think best applies?  More of the vector field is going into the square than going out.  Less of the vector field is going into the square than going out.  The same amount of the vector field is going into the square as is going out.     There is less of going into the region around than is going out. There is more of going into the region around than is going out. There is the same amount of going into the region around than is going out.   There is less of going into the region around than is going out. There is more of going into the region around than is going out. There is the same amount of going into the region around than is going out.    For each of the vector fields , , and (and corresponding square), does your answer to part suggest that the vector field is being created, destroyed, or is unchanging in strength inside the square? Write a sentence to explain your thinking for each vector field.   Because there is less of going into the region around than is going out, this suggests that is being destroyed around . Because there is more of going into the region around than is going out, this suggests that is being created around . Because there is the same amount of going into the region around than is going out, this suggests that is not changing stength around .   Because there is less of going into the region around than is going out, this suggests that is being destroyed around . Because there is more of going into the region around than is going out, this suggests that is being created around . Because there is the same amount of going into the region around than is going out, this suggests that is not changing stength around .    Would the answer to parts or change if you used a smaller square centered on , , and for the corresponding vector fields? Write a sentence to explain your thinking for each vector field.   A smaller square would not change the argument to any of these questions. The vector field will be larger on the top and right of than on the bottom and left. The vector field will be larger on the top, bottom, and left of than on the right (which is the only boundary piece where is flowing out of the region). The vector field will have the same amount flowing in on the bottom and right as is flowing out on the top and left (regardless of size of the square).   A smaller square would not change the argument to any of these questions. The vector field will be larger on the top and right of than on the bottom and left. The vector field will be larger on the top, bottom, and left of than on the right (which is the only boundary piece where is flowing out of the region). The vector field will have the same amount flowing in on the bottom and right as is flowing out on the top and left (regardless of size of the square).    Thinking now only about the vector field , would your answers to parts , , or change if you considered squares around points , , or ? Write a couple of sentences to explain your thinking.   For all points shown and regardless of size of the square used, the vector field will have the same amount flowing in and out of the square. This is because has a purely rotational aspect, so the amount rotation into a given square will be exactly matched by an amount rotation out on the opposite side.   For all points shown and regardless of size of the square used, the vector field will have the same amount flowing in and out of the square. This is because has a purely rotational aspect, so the amount rotation into a given square will be exactly matched by an amount rotation out on the opposite side.      Definition of the Divergence of a Vector Field  We begin this subsection by stating a definition that captures analytically the ideas you reasoned aboug geometrically in . After the statement of the definition, we discuss what it means.    The divergence of a vector field  is given by . In two dimensions, the definition is analogous by omiting the third term.     Alternative Notation for Divergence  In other sources you may see the divergence written using a dot product as . This notation is very compact and works well with the understanding that the del operator is a function that operates on other functions. However, this notation can also be confusing because of its emphasis on computation rather than conceptual understanding. In this text, we will not generally write the divergence using the del operator.   The divergence of a vector field is a scalar measurement at a point that measures how the strength of the vector field is changing as we look in small neighborhoods around our point. While will show the details for how the divergence is defined, we can make the following qualitative argument: If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point , then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. We make this measurement of changing strength of the vector field by measuring how much of a vector field flows into versus out of a small neighborhood of our point (as was done in ). When looking at a small neighborhood of the point (as shown by the square in ), only the change of the horizontal component of the vector field contributes to flow in or out on the sides and only the change in the vertical component contributes to flow in or out on the top and bottom.   Let . Then . From our conceptual description above, being positive means that our vector field is increasing in strength. Since the divergence of does not have a dependence on the input point, that means the vector field is increasing in strength, regardless of which point we consider. In the interactive element below, you can change the point you would like plotted and the size of the region around the point. You should see that regardless of what point you select or how small you make the region around the point, there will be more of the vector field flowing out of the region than in.   An interactive plot of with point and region plotted      Let . We can compute that . From our conceptual description of divergence, being zero means that our vector field is not changing in strength. Since the divergence of does not have a dependence on the input point, that means the vector field is not changing in strength, regardless of which point we consider.  In the interactive element below, you can change the point you would like plotted and the size of the region around the point. You should see that regardless of what point you select or how small you make the region around the point, there will be exactly as much of the vector field flowing into the region as is flowing out (on the other side).   An interactive plot of with point and region plotted      Let , which means that . In constrast to the previous examples, you can see that the value of divergence of will depend on the input point choosen. For instance, will be at the point . This means that for a small region around there should be more of the vector field flowing out of the region than into it. Use the interactive element below to verify this.   An interactive plot of with point and region plotted    The divergence of at the point will be zero. If you look at this point in , you will see that there is exactly as much of the vector field flowing into the region around as is flowing out.  The divergence of at the point is . This should mean that there is more of the vector field flowing into the region around than is flowing out. You should be able to see how difference regions of the -plane will have different values for .   Another way to see divergence on a vector field plot is to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector field, then the divergence is zero. Also, remember that the divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and will change depending on location. The next activity asks you to graphically examine the divergence of three vector fields.   Graphical Representations of Divergence   For this part of the activity, consider the vector field shown in .   Vector field   A vector field with vectors pointing toward the origin. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases.      Draw a circle in the first quadrant of the vector field depicted in . Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of the circle, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in the first quadrant?   decreasing in strength   Putting a circle in the first quadrant, you will see that longer vectors are entering the circle from the top and right than are leaving the circle from the left and bottom. This is true regardless of where you put the circle. Thus, there is more of the vector field entering than leaving the circle and we can conclude the vector field is decreasing in strength in the first quadrant.   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the first quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude?   decrease in magnitude   The lengths of the vectors in are decreasing as you move toward the origin (which corresponds to the direction of flow).   Draw a circle in each of quadrants II, III, and IV. Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of your circles, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in quadrants III, II, and IV?   decreasing in strength   The same argument as from part (i) applies since more of enters on the sides opposite of the origin than leaves on the side towards the origin.   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the third quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude.   decrease in magnitude   The lengths of the vectors in are decreasing as you move toward the origin (which corresponds to the direction of flow).   Based on your arguments above, describe why the divergence of is negative for all points in the -plane.   At all points in the plane, there is more of entering the neighborhood of the point than is leaving the neighborhood. Therefore, the divergence of is negative for all points in the plane.   At all points in the plane, there is more of entering the neighborhood of the point than is leaving the neighborhood. Therefore, the divergence of is negative for all points in the plane.    Look at the plot of the vector field in and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane. You may need to make separate arguments for each of the four quadrants.   Vector field   A vector field in which vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases. Vectors are oriented as if they follow hyperbolas with asymptotes and . Vectors above both asymptotes or below both asymptotes result in counterclockwise rotation. The other vectors result in clockwise rotation.      No change in strength anywhere   If you look at the figure below, you can see that a careful examination of the amount of the vector field entering and leaving a circle is balanced, regardless of where you put your circle. This is a bit subtle but you have to look at the total amount of vector field entering the region and not just the length of the vectors. A small amount entering over a larger length of boundary can cancel out a set of longer vectors leaving the region through a short segment of the boundary.   A vector field with vectors pointing toward the origin. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases.      Look at the plot of the vector field in below and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane. You may need to make separate arguments for each of the four quadrants.   Vector field    A vector field having longer vectors where . For , vectors appear to get longer as distance from the -axis increases.      QI: increasing in strength, QII: increasing, QIII: decreasing, QIV: decreasing   In the first quadrant, you will see that vectors are getting longer as you move along the flow of the vector field. Thus the vector field is increasing in strength in QI. Similiarly, you can see that the lengths of vectors decreasing as you move along the flow of the vector field in QIII and QIV and increasing in length along the flow in QII. Thus, the vector field is increasing in strength in QII and decreasing in strength in QIII and QIV.    The next activity of this section asks you to do some algebraic calculations of divergence using .    Calculate the divergence of the vector fields given below.                                  Explain how your answers to the questions in can be explained by using your results from part of this activity.     As you saw in part (a) of , we had a divergence that was negative for every point in plane and we have a calculated value of .    As you saw in part (c) of , we had a divergence that was negative for points in quadrants III and IV and positive divergenge for quadrants I and II. A careful examination of the change in the strength of the vector field in part (c) of , shows that the divergence gets large as you move vertically on the graph. This lines up exactly with .       As you saw in part (a) of , we had a divergence that was negative for every point in plane and we have a calculated value of .    As you saw in part (c) of , we had a divergence that was negative for points in quadrants III and IV and positive divergenge for quadrants I and II. A careful examination of the change in the strength of the vector field in part (c) of , shows that the divergence gets large as you move vertically on the graph. This lines up exactly with .        Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field  In this subsection, we examine the details of how to measure the density of the creation or destruction of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point. Next, using a limit, we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because vector fields change in a continuous fashion, the vector fields don't actually change at a single point . Rather, we will measure the density for the change in strength of the vector field.  We will develop all of our measurements in a two dimensional setting for now. However, our arguments can be applied to three (or more) dimensions. We start in the same fashion as in . Namely, we will look at how much of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered at a point . For this development, we will consider a two-dimensional vector field given by .   A square around the point   A square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and centered at the point . The upper-right corner of the square is labeled .     We can parametrize the top edge of the box by with . Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized by all of which use parameter values in .  The amount of the vector field that is created inside the square around the point can be measured by the net amount of the vector field coming into or going out of the square. The amount of vector flow that goes through each of the boundary segments can be measured by looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field on each particular segment. For instance, on the top segment, the vertical component determines how much of the vector field goes in or out of the square. Integrating just the vertical component of the vector field over the points on the top segment of our square will therefore measure how much of the vector field goes through the top of the square.  The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square. Similarly, if we want to measure how much of goes through either the left or right side of the square, we need to integrate the horizontal component . Hence, the net flow of the vector field into or out of the square will be given by . Notice that the integrals corresponding to the left and bottom segments are subtracted because we need to pay attention to the orientation of the vector field relative to the square. A positive vertical component of the vector field ( ) will correspond to flow out on the top of the square but will correspond to the vector field flowing into the square on the bottom. In the integrals above, we are counting the flow out of the square as positive and the flow in as negative.  We are measuring the net flow through the square as a scalar quantity. By decreasing , we can look at what happens to our amount of flow out of the square as we shrink to the point . In order for this to make sense across different size of squares, we will change what we are measuring to be a density argument by calculating flow in (or out) per unit area. This will allow us to compare our net flow calculations across squares with different areas. In other words, we want to consider what happens to as goes to zero.  Before we compute our limit, we will take a moment to simplify our integrals in order to make the limit easier to evaluate. Recall that in single-variable calculus, we defined the average value of a function  on an interval to be . It turns out that we can say something stronger: there will be a value in the interval so that when is continuous on . (You can think of the left-hand side as being the area of a rectangle with the interval as its base.) We use this fact, sometimes called the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, to simplify here. Applying the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to the first integral gives , where is some value in the interval . Applying the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to each of the other integrals allows us to simplify the expression above for the net flow to be , where and are values in and and are values in . Thus our flow density can be measured by looking at the limit as of the net flow (in or out) over the square divided by the area of the square. .  To simplify the limit further, we will reorganize our limit expression. Specifically, we collect the and terms separately. This gives . Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from Section 1.5.2 and as , the numbers must go to and must go to . Therefore, after evaluating our limit, the flow density is .  While this simplification may seem a bit amazing and magical, our conceptual steps should help us make sense of the result. If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. How the horizontal component changes over small steps in the vertical direction will give us information about how the direction of the vector field changes but not how the strength of the vector field is changing.  The arguments we made about measuring how much of the vector field flows into or out of a square has straightforward generalization to three (or more) dimensions. However, doing so requires a method for measuring how much of a vector field flows through a surface. This will be the subject of .    Summary     The divergence of a vector field is computed as In three dimensions, the divergence of the vector field is computed as     The divergence of a vector field measures the density of change in the strength of the vector field. In other words, the divergence measures the instantaneous rate of change in the strength of the vector field along the direction of flow.    The accumulation of the divergence over a region of space will measure the net amount of the vector field that exits (versus enters) the region.   The key ideas when interpreting divergence are:  A positive divergence means that the vector field is growing in strength.  A negative divergence means that the vector field is decreasing in strength.  A zero divergence means that the vector field is not changing in strength.            Find the divergence of each of the following vector fields at all points where they are defined.  (a)   (b)   (c)                         Consider .  (a) Is this a vector or a scalar?   vector    scalar    (b) Calculate it:   + =                       (a)  is a scalar (b) We have         Let  (a)   (b) Find so that for all                      Let and let Show that .   Vector fields with a zero divergence everywhere in their domain are called divergence-free vector fields. Which of the following vector fields are divergence-free?     where is a scalar function of , , and     Let . Calculate the divergence of and give a point where .  Is a divergence free vector field?               , thus the vector field is divergence-free.  , thus this vector field is NOT divergence-free  , thus this vector field is NOT divergence-free  which is not always zero. For instance, if , then . Thus vector fields of the form are not necessarily divergence-free.      If , then . Thus , but in general is not divergence-free.   The vector field is not a divergence free vector field.               , thus the vector field is divergence-free.  , thus this vector field is NOT divergence-free  , thus this vector field is NOT divergence-free  which is not always zero. For instance, if , then . Thus vector fields of the form are not necessarily divergence-free.      If , then . Thus , but in general is not divergence-free.   The vector field is not a divergence free vector field.       Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section relies heavily on understanding vector fields from . We have separated the details of how the flux density of a region leads to the definition and understanding of the divergence ( ). The second subsection is optional, but is worthwhile reading for students who are interested in a good conceptual understanding of how divergence is developed.   "

We begin with graphs of the three vector fields, , , and . Parts , , and ask you to answer the same three questions about the vector field and square illustrated in each of the figures. Part asks you to think further about the third vector field.   Vector Field   A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin. The length of vectors increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .      Vector Field   A vector field with vectors below the -axis pointing primarily up near the axis and primarily to the right farther away from the axis. Above the -axis, vectors point primarily to the right. Vector magnitudes are shortest near the positive -axis. There is a square in the second quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of the circle, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in the first quadrant?   decreasing in strength   Putting a circle in the first quadrant, you will see that longer vectors are entering the circle from the top and right than are leaving the circle from the left and bottom. This is true regardless of where you put the circle. Thus, there is more of the vector field entering than leaving the circle and we can conclude the vector field is decreasing in strength in the first quadrant.   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the first quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude?   decrease in magnitude   The lengths of the vectors in are decreasing as you move toward the origin (which corresponds to the direction of flow).

Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of your circles, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in quadrants III, II, and IV?   decreasing in strength   The same argument as from part (i) applies since more of enters on the sides opposite of the origin than leaves on the side towards the origin.   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the third quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude.   decrease in magnitude   The lengths of the vectors in are decreasing as you move toward the origin (which corresponds to the direction of flow).   Based on your arguments above, describe why the divergence of is negative for all points in the -plane.   At all points in the plane, there is more of entering the neighborhood of the point than is leaving the neighborhood. Therefore, the divergence of is negative for all points in the plane.   At all points in the plane, there is more of entering the neighborhood of the point than is leaving the neighborhood. Therefore, the divergence of is negative for all points in the plane.    Look at the plot of the vector field in and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane.

Vectors are oriented as if they follow hyperbolas with asymptotes and . Vectors above both asymptotes or below both asymptotes result in counterclockwise rotation. The other vectors result in clockwise rotation.      No change in strength anywhere   If you look at the figure below, you can see that a careful examination of the amount of the vector field entering and leaving a circle is balanced, regardless of where you put your circle. This is a bit subtle but you have to look at the total amount of vector field entering the region and not just the length of the vectors. A small amount entering over a larger length of boundary can cancel out a set of longer vectors leaving the region through a short segment of the boundary.

QI: increasing in strength, QII: increasing, QIII: decreasing, QIV: decreasing   In the first quadrant, you will see that vectors are getting longer as you move along the flow of the vector field. Thus the vector field is increasing in strength in QI. Similiarly, you can see that the lengths of vectors decreasing as you move along the flow of the vector field in QIII and QIV and increasing in length along the flow in QII.

  "body": " The Curl of a Vector Field     What is meant by rotation of a vector field in a plane?    How can a two-dimensional measurement of rotation be generalized to work in three dimensions?    How can the rotational strength of a vector field be measured?      In , we examined how the strength of a vector field in two (or more) dimensions changed in different regions. In particular, we developed the divergence of a vector field as a local (or density) measurement for how the strength of the vector field changes. The key ideas when interpreting divergence are:  A positive divergence means that the vector field is growing in strength.  A negative divergence means that the vector field is decreasing in strength.  A zero divergence means that the vector field is not changing in strength.    In many physical settings, it is also useful to measure the rotational strength of a vector field at a local scale. For instance, the vector field on the left of Figure shows a vector field which flows in a counterclockwise fashion around the origin. The vector field on the right of Figure shows a vector field which does not have a rotational aspect to its flow.   Examples of vector fields with global rotation properties (left) and without rotation in either the global or local sense (right)    A vector field exhibiting counterclockwise rotation around the origin. Vectors appear to be tangent to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.     A vector field with vectors pointing toward the origin. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases.      These global ideas of rotation are nice, but are not always visually apparent or may only appear in some regions. For instance, the vector field on the left of seems to have rotation around at least a couple of different points. In each quadrant, the vector field on the right of has different rotational patterns.   Examples of vector fields with varying rotation properties    A vector field having longer vectors where . For , vectors appear to get longer as distance from the -axis increases.     A vector field with vectors shortest along the line and longer as distance from that line increases. Vectors in the fourth quadrant point primarily in the positive -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the second quadrant point primarily in the negative -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the first and third quadrants exhibit a form of counterclockwise rotation.        We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of spinner we imagine is illustrated in . It consists of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner's paddle. In this activity, we will be trying to assess how the the spinner will rotate around the black axel (as an axis of rotation).   A paddle-bladed spinner    To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field in . As you think about these questions, draw an X at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.   The vector field   A vector field that has only nonzero vertical component that is upward and increasing as you move horizontally to the right and downward as you move to the left.       Draw an X at the origin to act as your spinner. Draw a vector on the top right blade of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade. Next, draw a vector on each of the other blades of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going down. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going down.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going down. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going down.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at the origin would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the left side will move down and the right side will move up.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the left side will move down and the right side will move up.    Now we would like to look at the rotational strength of at the point . As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade. It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as the top right. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as on the bottom right.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as the top right. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as on the bottom right.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all. You should pay attention to which blades will have a stronger force (in comparison to the blade on the other side).   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the right blades to go up will be stronger than the upward force on the left blades.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the right blades to go up will be stronger than the upward force on the left blades.    Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all? Draw a representation of a spinner if necessary to demonstrate your ideas.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the left blades to go down will be stronger than the downward force on the right blades.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the left blades to go down will be stronger than the downward force on the right blades.    Are there any points on the -plane where the spinner would not turn counterclockwise?   There are no points at which a spinner would not turn counterclockwise under the force of this vector field.   There are no points at which a spinner would not turn counterclockwise under the force of this vector field.      Measuring the Circulation Density of Vector Field in  In this subsection, we will develop the measurement of the circulation density for a two-dimensional vector field. We will use this measurement to generalize to a notion of rotational strength in higher dimensional cases in the next subsection.  We will start by measuring the circulation of a vector field on a path around the point and use this measurement to define circulation density. Specifically, we will measure the circulation of a vector field as we move around a square centered at . Using this measurement, we will calculate the circulation density by dividing our measurement by the area enclosed. This will allow us to compare our measurement across regions of different sizes. By taking the limit of this circulation density as the square's side length goes to zero, we will have the circulation density at the point . Just as in our discussion of , we will look at a two dimensional setting first, then examine how our argument can be generalized to higher dimensions.  Let's start by measuring the circulation around a square with side length centered at a point . Namely, we will look at the line integral of our vector field as we move along the square curve shown in .   A square centered at the point with side lengths traveled counterclockwise   A square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The center of the square is at the point . The upper right corner of the square is labeled . Each edge of the square is oriented so that the overall orientation around the square is counterclockwise.     We can parametrize the top edge of the square using the parametrization for . Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized (over the same range of values for ) as follows:   In order to measure the circulation around the square, we want to know how much of the vector field is parallel to the direction of travel. Thus, along each of the sides of the box, we only need to look at one of the components of the vector field. The only contribution to the circulation on the top and bottom comes from the horizontal component . Similarly, the vertical component, , is all that contributes to the circulation on the right and left sides. This means that we can simplify our line integrals considerably once we apply . For instance, the circulation on the top can be written as Similarly, we can simplify the appropriate line integrals on the other sides (ordered below as top, left, bottom, right) to get the total circulation around the square to be Note that on the top and the left sides, we must switch the sign because the direction of travel on these sides is in the negative coordinate direction. It is important to note that by convention, we talk about positive rotation being counterclockwise and negative rotation being clockwise when looking at these planar graphs. This will be discussed more fully in .  As with our development of divergence, we apply the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to the four integrals above to simplify future calculations. Specifically, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals applied to the first integral tells us that there is a value, , in the interval such that Applying the same arguments to the other three integrals in our Total Circulation calculation gives Here we have and . We can regroup these terms to get the following expression for the total circulation around our square:   A larger square is likely to have a larger total circulation since there is more distance to accumulate how much the vector field is moving in the same direction as our path. This is why the side length of the square appears as a factor in the formula for our total circulation. In order to compare our rotational or circulation ideas over different sizes of squares, we will now look at the circulation density (strength of rotation per unit area), which can be computed directly from our total circulation measurement. We can take the limit of the circulation density as we shrink the square to the central point and get a measurement rotational strength of our vector field at a point.  We will compute our circulation density as . Since the area of the square is , this gives us that the circulation density is . Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from Section 1.5.2 and notice that as , must go to and must go to . Therefore, our circulation density measurement at a point is   You may have noticed that this argument had a similar flow to the development of divergence in Section . However, the result here is different because the property of the vector field we were trying to measure was different. Because divergence was developed to measure the change in the strength of the vector field (without regard to the direction), divergence is computed using the partial derivatives of the horizontal component of the vector field with respect to the horizontal variable and the vertical component of the vector field with respect to the vertical variable. The circulation density we just developed measures how the direction of the vector field is changing, and thus uses partial derivatives of the components with respect to the transverse variable. In other words, the rotational aspects of the vector field depend on how the horizontal component of the vector field changes when we move vertically (and vice versa).  We could have used a shape other than a square in the development of the circulation density, but a square allows for calculations that are easier to understand as the area of the shape decreases.    Matching Visual Measurements to Algebraic Calculations   Remember that the circulation density of a vector field at a point is calculated as . The circulation density will be positive when a small spinner placed at will spin counterclockwise, negative when the spinner will move clockwise, and zero when the spinner does not rotate.  For each of the vector fields given below, answer the following questions:  What is the formula for the circulation density of the vector field?  For what points will you have a positive circulation density?  For what points will you have a negative circulation density?  For what points will you have a zero circulation density?

In this subsection, we will look at how this two-dimensional measurement can be used to define circulation density for three dimensional vector fields.   Rotation as a vector on the -plane    We first need to consider how we want to represent and measure rotation in three dimensions. When we developed the circulation density on the -plane, we measured the rotational strength at a point with an axis of rotation coming out of the -plane. This corresponds to the axis of rotation being given by the blue vector in . Remember that positive rotation corresponds to counterclockwise rotation in the -plane. We can generalize this idea to think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where  the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and  the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.  By convention, we consider positive rotation to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the terminal point of the vector to its initial point. In , you can see that each vector corresponds to the rotation displayed and is consistent with the conventions described above.   Rotation as a vector on each coordinate plane    If you look carefully at , you can see that the vector shown in blue will be parallel to and will represent rotations on planes of the form . Similarly, the vector shown in yellow will be parallel to and will represent rotations on planes of the form . When looking down the blue and yellow vectors (from the terminal to the initial point), you can see the positive coordinate axes as pointing to the right and up When placing the -axis horizontally for the blue vector and placing the -axis horizontally for the yellow vector (as we would expect on a two-dimensional plot). In contrast, when you look down the magenta vector (from the terminal to the initial point), the positive coordinate axes (the and axes) point to the left and up. When placing the -axis horizontally. In fact, when we look down the magenta vector the -plane is flipped. A positive rotation on a plane of the form will correspond to a rotation vector that is in the direction of . This is a consequence of the right-handed coordinate system and our right-handed idea of rotation, as reflected in the relationships amongst the vectors recalled below:     By using a vector to represent the rotation of some element, we have enabled all of the tools that vectors allow, especially the ideas of projection and linear combinations. Remember that the projection of a vector onto a vector will give the vector component of that is parallel to . In other words, the projection of onto is how much of is parallel to . The projection formula will allow us to take a vector representation of rotation and determine how much rotation happens around a given axis of rotation.  Recall that we have used a set of coordinate vectors (namely , , and ) to write other vectors as a linear combination of our base vectors. In other words, a vector in can be written in the form .   The black vector, , is decomposed into parts parallel to , , and .    The linear combination of vectors will allow us to build the total rotation vector by measuring the rotational strength in the direction of three coordinate direction vectors. Just as in , we will build our total rotation vector as a sum of , , and , but we will think of the initial point of the black vector as being at our point of interest A rotation vector in the direction of at a point will measure the circulation density at our point restricted to the trace plane . Similarly the rotation vectors in the directions and will measure the circulation density on the trace planes and , respectively.    Circulation Density in Three Dimensions  The previous subsection discussed how we can view the amount of rotation of a three-dimensional vector field in a plane parallel to the -, -, or -plane and recalled that vectors in can be written as a linear combination of the vectors , , and . We use our definition of curl for a two-dimensional vector field to measure the amount of rotation in the appropriate planes, which leads to the following definition.    Let be a three-dimensional vector field. The curl of is given by .     Alternate Notation for Curl  As with divergence, there is an alternate notation for curl that uses the del operator . Specifically, for a three-dimensional vector field , .   The curl is exactly the rotational description described at the end of . When evaluated at a point , the first component of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the plane . Similarly, the second and third components of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the planes and , respectively.   In this example, we will look at . Applying , Thus, . This means that will have a rotational aspect only with an axis parallel to the -axis. This should not be suprising since the plot of will be the same as copied on each plane . As you saw in , this vector field will have constant rotational strength at every point with axis of rotation in the direction.   We next consider an example where the trace of the vector field in planes parallel to coordinate planes is not as easy to visualize as in the previous example.   In this example, we will look at . If we apply , we obtain Therefore, we have . Thus, will have no rotational strength anywhere. In we have a plot of , which illustrates that dropping a spinner at any point in space will not have the spinner rotate. No matter what orientation the spinner will have, there will be equal force on each side of the spinner, and thus the spinner will not rotate.   The black vector, , is decomposed into parts parallel to , , and .      In this example, we will look at . By , Therefore, . This tells us that the vector field will have a non-zero curl for every point. However, it will be quite difficult to see the curl at a particular point. The next activity will take you through the process of trying to visualize and understand the output of curl in three dimensions.    Estimating Curl in Three Dimensions   Consider the vector field plotted in . You can adjust the size of the region around over which the vector field is plotted using the Zoom slider. The Density slider allows you to adjust the number of vectors plotted. Try to identify any rotation in the three dimensional vector field plot at the point . Write a sentence describing how a spinner placed at would rotate, including along which axis it would rotate. Try to state your answer as a vector representing the rotational strength of the vector field at .   A vector field plotted in a region around the point     The best way to estimate this rotation is to look at the planar approaches described in the next several parts.   The best way to estimate this rotation is to look at the planar approaches described in the next several parts.    You likely found it difficult to decide how you thought a spinner might rotate in this new, three-dimensional setting. Let's look at the vector field in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative. Summarize your result as a vector representing the rotational strength of in the plane .   The trace of in the plane   A vector field in two dimensions. The horizontal axis is labeled and ranges from to . The vertical axis has the same range and is labeled . There is a point marked at . Vectors point primarily down and are longer when closer to the horizontal axis. In the upper-left of the plot, the vectors point more down and left. In the lower-right of the plot, vectors point more down and right.          This figure shows that the forces on the blades of a spinner at the red point would be almost balanced. An important difference is going to be that arrow on the right side do not have quite as large of a vertical component as the vectors on the left. This will cause a spinner to rotate counterclockwise, so the rotational strength at this point will be negative. A representative form would be where represents the rotational strength at the point. So we will use with .    Next we will look at the vector field in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative. Summarize your result as a vector representing the rotational strength of your vector field in the plane . Do you think the rotation in this figure is stronger or weaker than in ?   The trace of in the plane   A vector field in two dimensions. The horizontal axis is labeled and ranges from to . The vertical axis ranges from to and is labeled . There is a point marked at . Vectors in the right half of the figure are longer and point primarily up, although slightly to the left. Vectors in the left half of the figure are very short and point primarily right until around , where they start to point up but are very short.          This figure shows that the forces on the blades of a spinner at the red point would cause the spinner to rotate counterclockwise, so the rotational strength at this point will be positive. Your answer should be of the form where represents the rotational strength at the point. Note that the vector coming out of the page would be in the direction. The strength of the rotation in this example is definitely larger than in part (b), so we will have an estimate of .    Finally, consider the trace of in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative. Summarize your result as a vector representing the rotational strength of your vector field in the plane . How do you think the rotation in this figure compares (i.e., stronger or weaker) to that in and ?   The trace of in the plane   A vector field in two dimensions. The horizontal axis is labeled and ranges from to . The vertical axis ranges from to and is labeled . There is a point marked at . Vectors on the left and bottom sides of the figure are slightly longer than vectors in the top and right portions of the figure. Vectors point predominantly up, although those in the lower-corner point up and left, with vectors becoming closer to upright as one moves to the upper-right corner.          This figure shows that the forces on the blades of a spinner at the red point would cause the spinner to rotate clockwise, so the rotational strength at this point will be negative. Your answer should be of the form where represents the rotational strength at the point. Note that the vector coming out of the page would be in the direction. The difference in the forces on the blades in this figure are are about the same as those involved in part (c), so we would estimate that this rotation will about the same as in part (c), thus we estimate the rotation vector to be .    Summarize your prediction to what you think the three-dimensional rotational strength of the vector field will be at the point in the form of three-dimensional vector.  Add your results from the previous three steps.           Compute the curl of . Specifically, what is at the point ?    , so     , so     Compare the result of the curl calculation in part to your prediction from part . You likely found it difficult to estimate the magnitude, so your answer there may be incorrect. Hopefully, you did get the signs of the components and their relative strengths (i.e., which is biggest) correct. If you did not, go back and review the previous parts and explain why the calculated components match with the rotational strength for each of the three figures.   The most likely parts to have missed are the slight rotation involved in part (b) and guessing the relative strengths of the rotations. There are subtle signs of the rotation in for part (b) so you may have said this had zero rotational strength.   The most likely parts to have missed are the slight rotation involved in part (b) and guessing the relative strengths of the rotations. There are subtle signs of the rotation in for part (b) so you may have said this had zero rotational strength.      Interpretation and Usage of Curl  It is worth making explicit a fact that we have used implicitly throughout this section: the curl of a vector field is itself a vector field! That is, evaluating at a point gives a vector. As we saw earlier in this section, the vector output of represents the rotational strength of the vector field as a linear combination of rotational strengths (or circulation densities) from two-dimensional planar descriptions. From our description of vectors as a representation of rotations, We can think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where  the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and  the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.  By convention, we consider positive rotation to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the end of the vector to the base.  With these conventions, the output vector of the curl evaluated at a point , written as , will have the following properties:  The direction of will be the axis of rotation that has the strongest positive rotational strength.  The magnitude of will be the circulation density of the vector field in the plane through with normal vector .    The following theorem allows us to use to measure the rotational strength of around an arbitrary axis. This will be particularly useful to us in later sections.    The rotational strength of a vector field around an axis given by a unit vector at a point can be computed by .    This follows from the formula for the component of along and the fact that was selected to be a unit vector.       In this activity, we will work on calculating curl algebraically and interpreting it.    Consider the vector field . If we plot this vector field in any plane through the origin, we will see the vector field shown in . This two-dimensional vector field has no rotation. The projection of onto any direction therefore must give the zero vector. The only vector that has a zero projection in every direction is the zero vector. Verify this geometric argument for the curl of by doing the calculations necessary to show that .   The vector field on every plane through the origin   A vector field with all vectors radiating from the origin. Vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases.               Now consider the vector field , which is shown in . The figure includes both an interactive three-dimensional plot of as well as a two-dimensional plot of in the yellow plane, which can be adjusted using the Angle of Plane slider.   Two views of the vector field     Based on the figure, would you estimate the components of to be positive, negative, or zero at the origin? Does your answer change if you pick a different point?   All points would have positve components of curl since there will be counterclockwise rotation on every plane (not containing the z-axis).   All points would have positive components of curl since there will be counterclockwise rotation on every plane (not containing the z-axis).   Calculate algebraically. Does the curl of this vector field vary depending on the point at which the curl is measured?        , so the curl of the vector field does not depend on the point.   Explain why the rotational strength of the vector field on a titled plane through the origin will be given by , where is the angle between and the normal vector of the tilted plane.   By , the rotational strength of the vector field in a plane will be given by the dot product of the curl and the unit normal vector of the plane. Since the dot product of two vectors can be calculated by taking the product of the vector lengths and the cosine of the angle between the vectors, the rotational strength will be given by .   By , the rotational strength of the vector field in a plane will be given by the dot product of the curl and the unit normal vector of the plane. Since the dot product of two vectors can be calculated by taking the product of the vector lengths and the cosine of the angle between the vectors, the rotational strength will be given by .    In you can plot a vector field in a region around a point of your choosing in order to look at the rotational properties of the vector field. The check box in will show the curl vector at the base point specified so you can make sense of your vector field and its curl.   A plot of the vector field    Use the figure to estimate the direction of at the point . Confirm your estimate by calculating the curl at this point algebraically. Is there any point at which the direction of greatest rotational strength of this vector field has negative -component? If there is, find such a point. If not, explain why not.    . You should be able to rotate to view the point from a direction parallel to each axis to estimate the rotational strength that will correspond to the components of .    . You should be able to rotate to view the point from a direction parallel to each axis to estimate the rotational strength that will correspond to the components of .       Summary     The circulation of a vector field on a closed path measures how strong the vector field moves in the direction of travel for the path. The circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field is given by . The circulation density can be visualized in terms of how fast a very small spinner anchored to will rotate as a result of the force of .    By considering the circulation density of a three-dimensional vector field in planes parallel to the coordinate planes, we can calculate the curl of as .    For a three-dimensional vector field , the vector points along the axis of rotation with the greatest rotational strength at the point . The magnitude of measures the strength of the rotation in this maximal direction.

The figure below gives a sketch of a velocity vector field in the -plane. Note that vectors are given with a dot at the tail of each arrow.   (a) What is the direction of rotation of a thin twig placed at the origin along the -axis?    clockwise    counterclockwise    it won't rotate    (b) What is the direction of rotation of a thin twig placed at the origin along the -axis?    clockwise    counterclockwise    it won't rotate    (c) If we put a paddle wheel at the origin, instead of a twig, in what direction would you expect that to rotate?    clockwise    counterclockwise    it won't rotate    (d) Compute curl .                        (a) A thin twig at the origin along the -axis would only feel the velocity perpendicular to that axis, and thus would rotate in a clockwise direction. (b) Similarly, if oriented along the -axis, rotate in a counterclockwise direction. (c) Combining (a) and (b), we expect the paddle wheel will not rotate. (d) Using the Cartesian coordinate definition, we get This is as expected, since a paddle-wheel (instead of a twig) placed in the field would behave as indicated in (c).        For each of the vector fields below, decide if they have a nonzero or zero curl at the origin. Each vector field is shown in the -plane; they have no -component and are independent of . Note that the vector fields are shown with a dot at the tail of each vector.         (a)  (b)  (c)    Vector field (a) has   nonzero    zero   curl at the origin.

  "body": "  We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of spinner we imagine is illustrated in . It consists of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner's paddle. In this activity, we will be trying to assess how the the spinner will rotate around the black axel (as an axis of rotation).   A paddle-bladed spinner    To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field in . As you think about these questions, draw an X at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.   The vector field   A vector field that has only nonzero vertical component that is upward and increasing as you move horizontally to the right and downward as you move to the left.       Draw an X at the origin to act as your spinner. Draw a vector on the top right blade of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade. Next, draw a vector on each of the other blades of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going down. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going down.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going down. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going down.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at the origin would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the left side will move down and the right side will move up.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the left side will move down and the right side will move up.    Now we would like to look at the rotational strength of at the point . As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade. It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as the top right. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as on the bottom right.   The vector on the top right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the top left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as the top right. The vector on the bottom right blade will be vertical, going up. The vector on the bottom left blade will be vertical, going up but not as long as on the bottom right.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all. You should pay attention to which blades will have a stronger force (in comparison to the blade on the other side).   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the right blades to go up will be stronger than the upward force on the left blades.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the right blades to go up will be stronger than the upward force on the left blades.    Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all? Draw a representation of a spinner if necessary to demonstrate your ideas.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the left blades to go down will be stronger than the downward force on the right blades.   The spinner will move counterclockwise because the force exerted on the left blades to go down will be stronger than the downward force on the right blades.    Are there any points on the -plane where the spinner would not turn counterclockwise?   There are no points at which a spinner would not turn counterclockwise under the force of this vector field.   There are no points at which a spinner would not turn counterclockwise under the force of this vector field.   "

What is the meaning of the double integral of the circulation density of a smooth two-dimensional vector field on a region bounded by a closed curve that does not intersect itself?      We know from that a vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is . It is probably not surprising that, given the multitude of names we have for path-independent vector fields, they are important vector fields that arise frequently. However, not every vector field is path-independent, and many times we will want to calculate the circulation around a closed curve in a vector field that is not path-independent. This section explores a connection between line integrals and double integrals that you may find surprising. It will be the first of three major theorems that connect types of integrals that seem very different on the surface.    We will consider the vector field , which is defined on the entire -plane. Suppose that we want to calculate the circulation of around the circle of radius , centered at , and oriented counterclockwise.    Verify that is not path-independent by calculating the circulation of around the circle . The SageMath cell below is set up to assist you with this, but you will need to supply a parametrization of on line 4.      If we parametrize as , then . To use the SageMath cell to do this, make line 3 read C = vector([2*cos(t),2*sin(t)]) and execute. Because the circulation around is not , we know that is not path-independent.    Recall from that if is a vector field, then the circulation density (in 2D) is given by What is the circulation density of ?    No; .   Here we have that and , so we have that .    Sketch the curve and shade the region it bounds. Describe the region bounded by in both rectangular and polar coordinates.   Polar: , . Rectangular: , .   Since we know the radius of is , the region the circle bounds is covered by all values of with . For , since we have the full disk, the bounds are . In rectangular coordinates, the circle is . The range for is , and solving the equation of the circle for gives us as the bounds for .    Calculate the double integral of over the region inside the circle . This integral is not the most fun to do by hand, so a SageMath cell has been provided to assist you.    If you choose polar coordinates, use for the first variable and for the second variable.     Denote by the region inside the circle . We can describe readily in polar coordinates with the inequalities and . Thus, we need to calculate . Using SageMath to calculate this, we obtain .    What do you notice about your results to parts (a) and (d)? Do you think this will happen in general? Write a sentence or two about what you think is happening here.    A natural question after completing the Preview Activity is if there is something special about the vector field or the curve that led to the results you obtained, and investigating this will be our principal task in this section.    Circulation  In , you integrated the circulation density of a smooth vector field over a disk and found the result was equal to the circulation of the vector field along the region's circular boundary. This relationship is the theme of this section. To see why this would make sense, consider the region bounded by the curve shown in . We have placed a square grid inside to suggest the idea of breaking up into many smaller regions, most of which are square. This idea should make you think of the methods we have already seen of breaking up a region into smaller and smaller regions for Riemann sums.   A region bounded by a curve   A bean-shaped region in the plane that is bounded by a closed curve. The curve is oriented so that when walking along the curve, the region is always on the left. There is a square grid dividing the up the interior of the region.     The critical idea here is that if we integrate the circulation density over each of the small regions and add those up, this is the same as integrating the circulation density over the entirety of the region because of the fundamental properties of integrals. Also, integrating circulation per unit area over a two-dimensional region should be related to the total circulation on that region. Now look at and think of these two square regions as being two of the square regions inside in .   A square region divided into two smaller squares   A rectangular region in the plane that is bounded by a closed curve oriented counterclockwise. The square is divided into two squares of equal size, which are labeled as and . There are circular arrows inside each of the smaller regions indicating counterclockwise orientations.     We orient the boundary of square region in the manner suggested by the circular arrows. This means that the vertical boundary in common between and is oriented up when we calculate the line integral and oriented down when we evaluate . Thus, this line segment does not contribute to the sum . Therefore, is equal to the line integral of along the boundary of the large rectangle.  Returning to , if we find the circulation along the boundary of each of the smaller regions, the line integrals along the boundaries that lie inside the region will all offset. Thus the value should equal . If we make our grid fine enough, all of the smaller regions into which is divided will be very close to rectangular.    The calculation of circulation around a nice closed curve will be the sum of the circulation over pieces that enclose the same area, regardless of the size or number of the pieces used. In other words, where is a bounding curve for subregion . We defined our circulation density as the ratio of circulation to area, so we can also subsititute the circulation around a region for the circulation density times the area of that region. Additionally, we can take the limit as our regions get smaller, since size and the number of regions does not affect the sum. Letting represent the area of region with boundary curve , we have . This expression should look familiar as the Reimann sum definition for the double integral of over the region . For nice closed curves we can equate the circulation around the boundary (computed as a line integral) with a double integral of the circulation density over the region enclosed (computed with a double integral).    Green's Theorem  So far in this section, we have restricted ourselves to relatively nice closed curves when thinking about circulation. While the main theorem of this section will not allow us to consider arbitrary closed curves, it does cover more varied curves than we have discussed so far. A simple closed curve is a closed curve that does not cross itself, and these are the curves to which our next theorem applies.   A closed curve that is not simple  The restriction that the curve in prohibits curves such as the one below, which crosses itself.   A curve in the shape of a figure eight      Green's Theorem   Let be a simple closed curve in the plane that bounds a region with oriented in such a way that when walking along in the direction of its orientation, the region is on our left. Suppose that is vector field with continuous partial derivatives on the region and its boundary . The circulation of along may be calculated as .     At first glance, it may seem that is of purely intellectual interest. However, we have already encountered situations where parameterizing a curve can be complicated. This is particularly true when the curve has corners that require us to give separate parametrizations for several pieces of the curve, such as with the rectangular curve pictured in . However, as with this rectangle, is often the case that a curve that is difficult to parametrize bounds a region that is not too complex to describe using rectangular or polar coordinates. For instance, the rectangular region in can be described as and , which is a simpler description than needing to parameterize each of the four sides of the rectangle separately. Additionally, the integrand of the double integral in involves partial derivatives that can sometimes result in an integrand that is easy to work with. The purpose of is, at its core, to allow you to exchange one type of integration problem (a line integral) for another type of integration problem (a double integral). This will be a recurring theme as this chapter continues.   A rectangular curve   A rectangular curve in the -plane. The lower-left corner is labeled . The upper-right corner is labeled . The curve is oriented counterclockwise.      We will verify Green's Theorem by computing both sides of the equation separately when and is the bounding curve given in .  First, we calculate the double integral (the right hand side of the equation in Green's Theorem). The circulation density of will be , which is continuous everywhere in the region . Our iterated itegral becomes Note how easy it is to set up and evaluate this double integral.  We will need to compute the line integral of over the four segements of the bounding rectangle. We will use the following parameterizations: where each paramterization uses . These parameterizations will yeild the following line integrals: Note that the sum of these line integrals is 3, and thus Green's Theorem is verified for our case since      For each of the curves described below, find the circulation of the given vector field around the curve. Do this both by calculating the line integral directly as well as by calculating the double integral from .    The curve is the circle of radius centered at the point (oriented counterclockwise) and the vector field is .     Here we find that . Therefore, the integrand in is the constant . Thus, the circulation of around is times the area of the region inside . That area is , which means that the circulation is .    The curve is the triangle with vertices , , and (oriented counterclockwise) and the vector field is .     Here we find that . The region inside can be described by and . Therefore, by , we have .    Generally, is useful for allowing us to calculate line integrals by instead calculating a double integral. Going the other direction is harder, since finding a vector field so that is equal to the integrand in the double integral can be difficult. However, the exercises will explore some situations where calculating a suitable line integral is a viable alternative to the double integral.    What happens when vector fields are not smooth?  Notice that the assumptions in require that the region be bounded by a simple closed curve and that the vector field have continuous partial derivatives on and . In , we will explore what happens when the region cannot be bounded by a simple closed curve, as sometimes multiple applications of can be used in those circumstances. Now, however, we will take a look at what happens in some cases where the vector field is not smooth.    Consider the vector field . Notice that is smooth everywhere in the plane other than at the point . This vector field is plotted in , but we have not plotted the vectors close to the origin as their magnitudes get so large that they make it hard to interpret the figure. Here applies to any simple closed curve that neither passes through nor bounds a region containing .   The vector field   A vector field with vectors tangent to circles oriented counterclockwise and centered at the origin as well as the unit circle centered at the origin and oriented counterclockwise. The vectors are longer close to the origin and shorter farther from the origin.       Find the circulation density of (i.e., the integrand of the double integral in ).   Make sure to note any exceptional points at which your formula is not valid.   for   For , we have . Thus, .    Suppose that is the unit circle centered at the origin. Without doing any calculations, what can you say about ? what does this tell you about if is path-independent?   Positive; is not path-independent   Notice that is tangent to . Thus, must be positive. (In fact, the circulation of along is the length of or because consists of unit vectors and the vector field is is tangent to .) Since there is a closed curve with nonzero circulation, is not path independent.    What would you get if you integrated the circulation density of over the region bounded by ?   The circulation density is everywhere inside except at the origin, where it is undefined. That single point does not impact the value of the double integral of the circulation density, which is thus .    Do the previous two parts contradict ? Explain your reasoning.   No.   There is no contradiction because does not apply here. The region inside the curve includes the point , and is not defined at that point. Green's Theorem requires that the vector field be smooth at every point of .    Is the vector field , which is shown in , path-independent? Why or why not?   The vector field    A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin and orthogonal to circles centered at the origin. Vectors are longest near the origin and get shorter farther from the origin.      Yes   Let . Note that , and the domain of is the same as the domain of (all of except ). Thus, is a gradient vector field and is therefore path-independent.    Suppose that is the unit circle centered at the origin. Find . Can you do this using ?   ; No   We have already shown that is path-independent, and therefore since is a closed curve. Because is not defined at the origin, does not apply to this line integral.    We can now see that is a powerful tool. However it cannot be used for all line integrals. In particular, the restriction that the vector field be smooth on the entire region bounded by a simple closed curve creates limitations. This can occur even in cases where holes in the vector field's domain or points where the vector field is not continuously differentiable lie away from .    Summary      tells us that we can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field along a simple closed curve that bounds a region in the plane on which the vector field is also smooth by calculating the double integral of the circulation density instead of the line integral.    Integrating the circulation density of a smooth vector field on a region bounded by a simple closed curve gives the same value as calculating the circulation of the vector field around the boundary of the region with suitable orientation.         Calculate if:  (a)  is the circle oriented counterclockwise.    (b)  is the circle in the -plane oriented counterclockwise.               (a) The curve, , is closed and oriented in the correct direction for Green's Theorem. Writing for the interior of the circle, we have   (b) The circle given has radius and center . The argument in part (a) works for any circle of radius , oriented counterclockwise. So the line integral has the value .        Let and . Let be the path consisting of lines from to to to . Find each of the following integrals exactly:  (a)    (b)               (a) Since is a gradient vector field and is a closed curve, . (b) Since by Green's Theorem,         Suppose and is the counter-clockwise oriented sector of a circle centered at the origin with radius and central angle . Use Green's theorem to calculate the circulation of around .  Circulation =   (Click on graph to enlarge)        SOLUTION  Let be the region enclosed by the curve .  First note that the curve has a positive orientation. We will use Green's Theorem. We have , therefore Hence, Green's Theorem implies          Let . Consider the line integral of around the circle of radius , centered at the origin and traversed counterclockwise.  (a) Find the line integral for .  line integral =  (b) For which value of is the line integral a maximum?    (Be sure you can explain why your answer gives the correct maximum.)             (a) We use Green's Theorem. Let be the region enclosed by the circle . Then  Converting to polar coordinates, we have  (b) The integrand of the integral over the disk is . Since the integrand is positive for and negative for , the integrand is positive inside the circle of radius 3 and negative outside that circle. Thus, the integral over increases with until and then decreases. The maximum value of the line integral occurs when .        (a) Show that each of the vector fields , , and are gradient vector fields on some domain (not necessarily the whole plane) by finding a potential function for each.  For , a potential function is   For , a potential function is   For , a potential function is   (b) Find the line integrals of around the curve given to be the unit circle in the -plane, centered at the origin, and traversed counterclockwise.        (c) For which of the three vector fields can Green's Theorem be used to calculate the line integral in part (b)?  It may be used for   only F    only G    only H    F and G    F and H    G and H    F, G and H    (Be sure that you are able to explain why or why not.)                                      (a) We see that are all gradient vector fields, since  and Other answers are possible. (b) Parameterizing the unit circle, , by , , , we have , so The vector field is tangent to the circle, pointing in the opposite direction to the parameterization, and of length 2 everywhere. Thus The vector field points radially outward, so it is perpendicular to the circle everywhere. Thus  (c) Green's Theorem does not apply to the computation of the line integrals for and because their domains do not include the origin, which is in the interior, , of the circle. Green's Theorem does apply to .        Sometimes, the value in is in converting a double integral into a line integral. Recall that the area of a region in the plane can be found by calculating .   Find a smooth vector field such that the circulation density of is everywhere.  There are several ways to choose so that .       is one possible example, but any vector field that satisfies will work.   Write out both integrals in for the vector field you selected in part .           For positive real numbers , the ellipse can be parametrized as with . Find the area of this ellipse by calculating a line integral.           Find another vector field (different from the one you found in part ) that has circulation density everywhere, and calculate the area of the ellipse in part by calculating the circulation of along the ellipse.       We will use the vector field in this part. Thus we get the line integral    How many possible vector fields are there with circulation density everywhere? Why?   Infinitely many   Any vector field that satisfies will work.    The types of regions in to which applies are formally called simply connected regions . To be precise, a simply connected region in is a set so that there is a path between every pair of points in that stays inside and any simple closed curve in can be shrunk to a point while remaining inside . We can think of a simply connected region as being a region that does not have any holes . There are many instances where we can find a way to apply multiple times to work with regions that are not simply connected, however.    A region that is not simply connected       Breaking up a region         Explain why the region in is not simply connected.    If we let , then the orientation of is as required by when walking along the pieces of , the region is always on the left-hand side. Assume that is a vector field that is smooth on and . Using as a guide, write as a sum of double integrals, one over and the other over .    In , we considered the vector field and found that the circulation of around the unit circle centered at the origin (oriented counterclockwise) was . Show that for every simple closed curve in the plane that bounds a region containing the origin, .     For part , create a region as in using the curve in place of .     A curve enclosing cannot be contracted to a point.   Work as in the previous part with and being the clockwise-oriented circle of radius centered at the origin with small enough that lies entirely inside .        A simple closed curve lying in the region that encloses the curve cannot be contracted to a point while remaining in the region , so this region is not simply connected.    Assume that and are oriented from bottom to top. Then . The curve in the first set of parentheses in bounds the region , and the curve in the second set of parentheses bounds the region . Since is smooth on and , applies and we have .    Let be the circle of radius , centered at the origin and oriented clockwise , with chosen to be small enough that lies entirely within . Then is exactly the type of curve considered in the previous part, as is smooth on the curves and the region they bound. Here for all points in and , so the double integrals from are . Thus, we have that . Since is tangent to everywhere, we know that .       This exercise presents another occasion where can be used to convert a double integral into a line integral.   Recall from that the centroid of a lamina of area is given by . Find vector fields and so that , where is the boundary of the lamina .    Find the centroid of the triangle with vertices , , and for real numbers .         and (other answers are possible)    and        For , we need . It works nicely to let , in which case taking gives what we need. For , we need . It works nicely to let , in which case taking gives what we need.    Using the vector fields from above, note that the line integrals along the legs of the triangle are for both and . Thus, we parametrize the hypotenuse as with . The area of the triangle is , so we find .

Equation shows that we can compute the exact surface area by taking a limit of a Riemann sum which will correspond to integrating the magnitude of over the appropriate parameter bounds. What if we wanted to measure a quantity other than the surface area? Our focus in this section we will be the exploration of a specific case of this question: How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a surface? The geometric tools we have reviewed in this section, especially the vector , will be valuable.    The Idea of the Flux of a Vector Field through a Surface  In this section we will look at how to measure the amount of a vector field that flows through a surface in space. illustrates a plot that demonstrates this idea. Our definition of divergence in looked at measuring the amount of vector field flowing out of a small region on a 2D plane. In this subsection, we will set up a precise measurement of this same measurement but over a region of a curved surface in 3D.   A three-dimensional vector field and a surface    As with understanding line integrals of vector-valued functions in , we don't care about the output of the vector field at points away from the surface. We would really would like to examine the output vectors for the points on our surface. To do this, we will look at , which plots the output of our vector field at an array of points on our surface.   A three-dimensional vector field evaluated along a surface    The central question we would like to consider is How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a curved surface? , so we only need to consider the amount of the vector field that flows through the surface. Any portion of our vector field that flows along (or tangent) to the surface will not contribute to the amount that goes through the surface. In , we have split the vector field for points on our surface into two components. One component, plotted in green, is orthogonal to the surface. The component that is tangent to the surface is plotted in magenta.   The decomposition of three-dimensional vector field evaluated along a surface into normal and tangent components    In order to measure the amount of the vector field that moves through the plotted section of the surface, we must find the accumulation of the lengths of the green vectors in . Notice that some of the green vectors are moving through the surface in a direction opposite of others. In other words, we will need to pay attention to the direction in which these vectors move through our surface and not just the magnitude of the green vectors.  If we have a parameterization of the surface, then the vector varies smoothly across our surface and gives a consistent way to describe which direction we choose as through the surface. If we define a positive flow through our surface as being consistent with the yellow vector in , then there is more positive flow (in terms of both magnitude and area) than negative flow through the surface. Thus, the net flow of the vector field through this surface is positive.   Visualizing flux through a surface   In this activity, you will compare the net flow of different vector fields through our sample surface. In you can select between five different vector fields. Once you select a vector field, the vector field for a set of points on the surface will be plotted in blue. Each blue vector will also be split into its normal component (in green) and its tangential component (in magenta). The yellow vector defines the direction for positive flow through the surface.  Look at each vector field and order the vector fields from greatest net flow through the surface to least net flow through the surface. Remember that a negative net flow through the surface should be lower in your rankings than any positive net flow.   Five vector fields flowing through a surface, with decomposition into normal and tangential components           You should look at the combined lengths of the green vectors. Remember to pay attention to the direction of the yellow vector which shows which direction is positive flow through the surface. So, .      The Details of Measuring the Flux of a Vector Field through a Surface  Now that we have developed a conceptual understanding of what we are trying to measure, we can set up the corresponding Riemann sum to measure the flux of a vector field through a section of a surface. Let be the section of our surface and suppose that is parameterized by with and . The domain of is a region of the -plane, which we call , and the range of is .  As with most problems in integral calculus, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints and into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints . This divides into rectangles of size by . We index these rectangles as . Every has area (in the -plane) . The partition of into the rectangles also partitions into corresponding pieces which we call . From (specifically ) the surface area of is approximated by .   Pieces of the tangent planes that approximate a surface    We want to measure the total flow of the vector field through , which we will approximate on each and then sum to obtain the total flow. In other words, the flux of through is , where is the length of the component of orthogonal to .  For each , we approximate the surface by the tangent plane to at a corner of that partition element. This corresponds to using the planar elements in , which have surface area . The vector can be used to measure the orthogonal direction (and thus define which direction we mean by positive flow through ) on the partition element. This means that   Combining these pieces, we find that the flux through is approximated by , where . Therefore we may approximate the total flux by . Taking the limit as gives the following result.  Conceptually, the above limit shows how the argument in generalizes when measuring the flux of a vector field through a surface rather than just the surface area. The key difference between the Riemann sum above and Riemann sum used to set up is that we are using the dot product of the vector field with the normal vector to the surface (given by ) as the scalar value in our sum. This realization gives the following theorem, which states that the flux through a curved surface in space can be computed using a parameterization of the surface and a double integral over a flat region in the plane of parameter values.    Let a smooth surface be parametrized by over a domain . The total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .    In , you can change the number of sections in the partition and see the geometric result of refining the partition. In the next example, we will look at how is used on a part of a cone and make sense of the vector and the scalar .   In some Webwork exercises and other sources, you will see flux integrals specified with the following notations: While we will use the notation specified in primarily, the other notations come from combining the normal vector (calculated from the parameterization of the surface) and the area element into a single vector valued area element. In other words, .    In this example we will compute the flux of the vector field through the surface of the cone given by with . So that we can use , we first parameterize our surface and calculate based on that parameterization.  In cylindrical coordinates, our cone is described by which suggests that we can use and as and . Consider the parameterization with bounds and . Notice that is acting as both and . Calculating the partial derivatives of gives the following: Taking the cross product of and , we obtain the vector-valued function : . We may simplify this to . Notice that is very close to . If we think of as giving , then . The figure below shows the relationship between vectors and for a point on the surface.   A plot of our surface with the parameterization vector in green and the normal vector in magenta    In , the normal vector (as calculated from the parameterization) points inside the cone. This is the direction of positive flow when measuring the flux of the vector field. Our parameterization will also transform our vector field into a function of and . Specifically, Applying to our parameterization and vector field allows us to compute as an interated integral . Note that the result of this flux integral is negative, which means more of the vector field is going out of the cone than is coming into the cone.   A plot of the surface with the vector field for an array of points on the surface. The vector field has been scaled down by a factor of 5 in this plot.    In you can see much more of the vector field is flowing outside of the cone than inside, which matches with our result of calculating the flux as negative.   The next activity asks you to carefully go through the process of calculating the flux of some vector fields through a cylindrical surface.   Checking the Visualization for Flux    shows a plot of the vector field and a right circular cylinder of radius and height (with open top and bottom). Consider the vector field going into the cylinder (toward the -axis) as corresponding to positive flux.   The vector field and a right circular cylinder     Reasoning graphically, do you think the flux of throught the cylinder will be positive, negative, or zero? Write a few sentences jutifying your answer.   Zero   This is difficult to visualize when the whole vector field is present. There is a lot of visual clutter. The flux should be near zero because on each horizontal slice, you can see about as much of the vector field flowing into the circular slice as is is flowing out of it on another side.   Parameterize the right circular cylinder of radius , centered on the -axis, for . Be sure to give bounds on your parameters.    with and     with and    Based on your parameterization, compute , , and . Confirm that these vectors are either orthogonal or tangent to the right circular cylinder. Is your orthogonal vector pointing in the direction of positive flux or negative flux?           Use your parametrization to write as a function of and .   The -coordinate is given by the first component of .       Since and , .   Compute the flux of through the parameterized portion of the right circular cylinder.           Does your computed value for the flux match your prediction from earlier?   Yes, it does   Yes, this calculation matches the estimate from the first part.   Use to make an argument about why the flux of through the right circular cylinder is zero.   The vector field with normal and tangential components plotted on a right circular cylinder     The flux should be zero because on each horizontal slice, you can see as much of the vector field flowing into the circular slice as is is flowing out of it on another side.   The flux should be zero because on each horizontal slice, you can see as much of the vector field flowing into the circular slice as is is flowing out of it on another side.    Write a couple of sentences to explalin how the results of the flux calculations would be different if we used the vector field and the same right circular cylinder.   The flux of this new vector field will still be zero because the only change to the components of the vector field are in the last component.   The flux of this new vector field will still be zero because the only change to the components of the vector field are in the last component. With the right circular cylinder surface, the last component of the vector field will NOT contribute anything to the flux. In other words, changing the z-component of the vector field does not change the flux because the z-component will correspond to flow along this surface (and not through this surface).    write a couple of sentences to explain how the results of the flux calculations would be different if we used the vector field and the same right circular cylinder.   The result would still be zero.   The result of the flux integral would be zero, but this is because the flow of the vector field would only be along the surface. The vector field would not change with respect to height (z-coordinate) and would correspond to only rotation around the z-axis, which would be tangent to the surface. When setting up the flux integral, the dot product of and would be zero.     In the exercises for this section, we will look at some computational ideas to help us more efficiently compute the value of a flux integral. In many cases, the surface we are looking at the flux through can be written with one coordinate as a function of the others. For simplicity, we consider . Additionally, there will be exercises that guide you through common surfaces like spheres and cylinder surfaces.   Note that throughout this section, we have implicitly assumed that we can parametrize the surface in such a way that gives a well-defined normal vector. Technically, this means that the surface be orientable . Most reasonable surfaces are orientable. However, there are surfaces that are not orientable. Perhaps the most famous is formed by taking a long, narrow piece of paper, giving one end a half twist, and then gluing the ends together. Try doing this yourself, but before you twist and glue (or tape), poke a tiny hole through the paper on the line halfway between the long edges of your strip of paper and circle your hole. After gluing, place a pencil with its eraser end on your dot and the tip pointing away. Think of this as a potential normal vector. Keep the eraser on the paper, and follow the middle of your surface around until the first time the eraser is again on the dot. Is your pencil still pointing the same direction relative to the surface that it was before?     Summary     A flux integral of a vector field, , on a surface in space, , measures how much of goes through .    Let the smooth surface, , be parametrized by over a domain . The total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .    If is of the form over a domain , then the total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .          Compute the flux of the vector field through the rectangular region shown below, assuming it is oriented as shown and that and .   flux =        . So is a normal vector and is a unit normal vector. Since this points in both the positive -direction and the positive -direction, it is cirrectly oriented for this surface. Since the area of the rectangle is , we have and .        Calculate the flux of the vector field through a square of side length in the plane . The square is centered on the y-axis, has sides parallel to the axes, and is oriented in the positive y-direction.  Flux =   .

If necessary, enter as rho,  as theta, and as phi.  Flux =    A =  B =  C =  D =  (b) Evaluate the integral.  Flux = =   .                                      Compute the flux of the vector field through the surface which is the cone , with , oriented downward.  (a) Parameterize the cone using cylindrical coordinates (write as theta ).        with    and    (b) With this parameterization, what is ?  =  (c) Find the flux of through .  flux =                                                is parameterized by with and . We have Since the vector points upward, in the direction opposite to the specified orientation, we use Hence      The cone is not differentiable at the point . However the flux integral, which is improper, converges.        Compute the flux of the vector field through the parameterized surface oriented upward and given, for , by  flux =        is given by Since the -component, , of the vector is positive for , we see that points upward, in the direction of the orientation of we were given. Thus, we use and so we have           Are the following statements true or false?    If is an open-ended circular cylinder centered about the z-axis, oriented away from the z-axis, and , then the flux of through is zero.    If is the unit sphere centered at the origin, oriented outward and the flux integral is zero, then is perpendicular to at every point of .    If is the unit sphere centered at the origin, oriented outward and the flux integral is zero, then .    If is the unit sphere centered at the origin, oriented outward and , then the flux integral is positive.    If is the cube bounded by the six planes , , , oriented outward, and , then the flux of through is zero.    If is a rectangle with area 1 and is a rectangle with area 2, then    The area vector of a flat, oriented surface is parallel to the surface.    If is an open-ended circular cylinder centered about the z-axis, oriented away from the z-axis, and , then the flux of through is positive.           Let be the square in the -plane shown in the figure below, oriented with the normal pointing in the positive -direction. Estimate where is a vector field whose values at the labeled points are           is . We estimate the vector surface integral using the division and sample points given in the Figure. Each subsquare has area , therefore we obtain the following estimation:            F = and is the portion of the cone between the planes and oriented with normal vectors pointing upwards. Find the flux of the flow field F across :            Flux Through Surfaces of the Form  In this exercise, we will look at how to use a parametrization of a surface that can be described as to efficiently calculate flux integrals.   Suppose that is a surface given by . Find a parametrization of .   Use and .           Show that the vector orthogonal to the surface has the form .           For each of the three surfaces given below, compute , graph the surface, and compute for four different points of your choosing. You should make sure your vectors are orthogonal to your surface.                                    For each of the three surfaces in part , use your calculations and to compute the flux of each of the following vector fields through the part of the surface corresponding to the region in the -plane.   with given by                          For with given by over the surface given by , we get the following flux integral:     For with given by over the surface given by , we get the following flux integral:     For with given by over the surface given by , we get the following flux integral:        with as the triangular region of the -plane with vertices , , and                           For with as the triangular region of the -plane with vertices , , and , we get the following flux integral:     For with as the triangular region of the -plane with vertices , , and , we get the following flux integral:     For with as the triangular region of the -plane with vertices , , and , we get the following flux integral:        with given by                           For with given by over the surface given by , we get the following flux integral:     For with given by over the surface given by , we get the following flux integral:     For with given by over the surface given by , we get the following flux integral:       Calculating the Flux through a Sphere  For this activity, let be the sphere of radius centered at the origin.   Parametrize using spherical coordinates. Give your parametrization as , and be sure to state the bounds of your parametrization.   Use and .    for     for   Use your parametrization of to compute .  Your result for should be a scalar expression times . Explain why the outward pointing orthogonal vector on the sphere is a multiple of and what that scalar expression means.   The outward pointing normal vector for the sphere or radius will be parallel to the position vector because both point radially away from the origin.   The outward pointing normal vector for the sphere or radius will be parallel to the position vector because both point radially away from the origin.   Use your parametrization of and the results of part to calculate the flux through for each of the three following vector fields.         For , we get the following flux integral: So for , the flux integral will be .         For , we get the following flux integral: So for , the flux integral will be .         For and because , we get the following flux integral: So for , the flux integral will be .  Use computer software to plot each of the vector fields from part and interpret the results of your flux integral calculations.  If we used the sphere of radius 4 instead of , explain how each of the flux integrals from part would change. You do not need to calculate these new flux integrals, but rather explain if the result would be different and how the result would be different.      Increase    Does not change    Increase         The flux integral would increase for the sphere of radius 4 because both the surface area and the length of the output of the vector field increase (as R goes from 2 to 4).    The flux integral result would not change for the sphere of radius 4. Exactly as much of the vector field will go out of the top hemisphere as will go into the bottom hemisphere. The x and y components of the vector field will rotate tangent to the sphere, so the constant z-component of 1 will give a net flux of 0.    Since and , then the flux integral will increase as we go to radius 4.                 Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section relies on parameterized surfaces, which was first introduced in . While some of the activities in this section may be too much for a single student to do in a class setting, we suggest that different cases of the vector fields and surfaces can be split for small group work. Students can then present answers to the larger group.   "

  "body": " Surface Integrals of Scalar Valued Functions     How can we measure the accumulation of a scalar-valued function along a surface in space?    What does that accumulation measure?    How can we efficiently calculate scalar surface integrals?        In we looked at how to understand line integrals of scalar functions through the analogy of running a mining machine along a given path. In short, the amount of copium mined depended on the density of copium at points on the path and the length of the path driven by the mining rig.   A plot of land with density of copium deposits and the edges of the plot drawn in yellow      The opening tasks of had you estimating the amount of copium mined by driving along the edge of a plot of land (drawn in yellow on ). This iterpretation meant that the scalar function we were using measured the linear density of copium. Thus, the Riemann sum we computed was the product of linear density of copium with the distance traveled.    In this task, we will interpret as a contour graph of the density of copium per unit area. This will allow us to compute the total amount of copium in our mining area by setting up a double integral. To approximate the total amount of copium available in our mine, do the following:   Break the mining plot (the area inside the yellow segments of ) into three pieces. Estimate the area of the three pieces you are using. Write a few sentences explaining your methods of estimating the areas.   For each of the three pieces you used in part , estimate the average density of copium on the piece. Write a few sentences explaining your methods of estimating the average density on each piece.   Give an estimate for the total amount of copium on the mining plot and explain your computation.          Cutting the region up into three pieces as shown with the plot above, we can estimate the areas and copium densities for each piece as follows:  The lower left triangle will have area of around 30,000 square meters and have a density of around 3.  The middle figure will have area of around 30,000 square meters and have a density of around 1.5.  The upper right triangle will have area of around 60,000 square meters and have a density of around 2.5.  Summing these area estimates times the densities will give a total estimate of 285,000. Your estimates will vary.    What if instead of your mining plot being on a flat piece of land as represented in , your mining plot was on a hill as represented in . If we had the same copium density plot as a function of the coordinates, which of the following would you expect to be true?  the total amount of copium available on is greater than on   the total amount of copium available on is lesser than on   the total amount of copium available on is the same as on   Explain your reasoning for your choice.   A 3D plot of the region including our mining area (shown with boundary in red)     The total amount of copium available on is greater than on    The total amount of copium available on is greater than on because the surface area of the region on the hill ( ) will be greater than the area of the corresponding flat parts of .    In , the idea of a flux integral was introduced by looking at how much of a vector field flows through a given section of a surface in space. In particular, the flux integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is orthogonal to the surface, which changes at different points on the surface. gives an efficient way to calculate a flux integral in terms of a parameterization of the surface. This was an extension of the method for computing the surface area given in .  Just as we generalized line integrals of vector fields into scalar line integrals in , we will spend this section examining questions related to the accumulation of scalar-valued functions along surfaces in space as a means of generalizing flux integrals.    Defining surface integrals of scalar functions  In order to create a Riemann sum that will measure the acculumation of , a scalar valued function, over , a smooth, bounded surface in space, we will break our surface into smaller pieces where we can approximate the value of and the surface area of each piece. Recall that in and , we developed a way to measure surface area given a parameterization for the surface.  Suppose that is parameterized by with and . In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints and we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints . This divides into rectangles of size by . We index these rectangles as . Every has area (in the -plane) of . The partition of into the rectangles also partitions into corresponding pieces which we call . From (specifically equation ) the surface area of is approximated by .  We illustrate this approximation of by rectangular patches of tangent planes, each with area in , where you can adjust the slider to control the number of rectangles. (For simplicity, the figure takes .)   Pieces of the tangent planes used to approximate surface area    To measure the accumulation of the output of over , we use the following Riemann sum: . as and , a double Riemann sum of this form represents the double integral (over the variables and ) of the function . This leads to the following theorem.    Let a smooth surface be parametrized by over a region , and let be a continuous function on a neighborhood around . The accumulation of over is denoted by and is called the scalar surface integral of over . The scalar surface integral of over is computed as .    In the following example, we both reason about the value of a scalar surface integral without working through computations and apply to compute values of scalar surface integrals.    For this example, we will consider the surface given by such that . This is the same part of the cone used in . We also let .    For our first part of our example, we use symmetry to reason about . Without using any calculations or parameterizations, we can reason that this scalar surface integral will be zero. In a scalar surface integral, we are calculating the accumulation of the scalar output over a surface area in space. In , you can see that we can symmetrically break our surface into two regions that have exactly the same surface area properties and symmetric output values for our scalar function, . Here we denote by the portion of with (colored green), while is the magenta portion of the surface, which has . The only difference between the green and magenta portions of that is relevant to our surface integral is that the values of will be positive on the green surface and negative on the magenta surface No matter how we break up the Riemann sum or the corresponding scalar surface integral for the green side of our surface, applying the same pattern to the magenta side will give the same result but with an opposite sign. In other words, .   The surface divided into regions with positive -coordinate in green and with negative -coordinate in red    Therefore, .    From a calculation standpoint, we can verify this result using our parameterization from in . Specifically, we will use the parameterization of given by with bounds and . We also know from that . Hence, we have . Thus, gives . Notice that we can evaluate this integral quickly because the inside integral is .    If we want to calculate the integral of over , then we have very little extra work to do. Only the bounds on the integral will change since we are using the same parameterization and function from the previous part. We can use the parameterization given by with and . As before, . Thus, gives .  It makes sense that the result of is positive because the output of our function is non-negative for all points on . Remember that the Riemann sum used in calculating surface integrals of scalar functions is the product of the function's value on each piece times the estimate of the surface area. Thus, if the function's value is positive for all points on the surface, then the scalar surface integral will also be positive.    Before moving on to an activity that gives you a chance to practice reasoning about scalar surface integrals, we consider an additional example. We   For this example, we will consider the same surface as in , but we will change the scalar function we are integrating to something more complicated. Our goal is to calculate . We can reuse the parameterization and calculations from above for here and move directly to setting up the iterated integral. We will take a moment here to note that converting our scalar function to a function of and will give . Therefore, we have the following iterated integral, which we evaluate:   This result is a bit more difficult to to make sense of as being negative. In , we have a plot of the surface in blue and the parabolic cylinder surface given by is plotted in yellow. The points on the yellow surface correspond to where our scalar function ( ) gives an output of zero. The points inside the parabolic cylinder have a -coordinate greater than , which means that will have a positive output for these points. The points outside of the parabolic cylinder have a -coordinate less than , which means that will have a negative output for these points. In order to make an argument about whether is positive, negative, or zero, we will need to assess whether there is more surface area where takes on positive values, more with negative values, or an equal amount of positive-negative values. Actually, our problem is even harder than this! Beacuse the Riemann sum is the product of the output for each piece of our surface times the surface area estimate, we will need to think about which points\/pieces have larger or smaller outputs for . This is very difficult in general, because we need a systematic way of estimating both the output of and the surface area of different pieces of the surface.   The surface is plotted with the surface given by    In our case, there is more surface area of inside the parabolic cylinder than outside. For points that are far away from the yellow surface, the magnitude of the value of for that point will be large. For points that are close to the yellow surface, the -coordinates are close to , and thus values of are close to zero. This means that in order to properly estimate the scalar surface integral, we must assess whether there is a greater weighted surface area inside the parabolic cylinder than outside, where the weight of each surface area piece is given by how far the piece is from the yellow parabolic cylinder. This is not an easy argument to make, and is not easy to verify visually for this example. For some examples, you may be able to make a nice geometric arguement about the size of scalar surface integrals, but the algebraic calculation given by gives an exact value.   In the next activity, we consider some situations where we can reason about the sign of a surface integral of a scalar function.    In this activity, we will try to understand the scalar surface integral by looking at whether the value of the scalar surface integral will be positive, negative, or zero over common surfaces. In each part below, you are given a function and a surface. For each surface, first draw a plot of the surface and make sure you have labeled a proper scale for each coordinate direction. Then reason if the given surface integral is positive, negative, or zero. Be sure to justify your answers in terms of the function being integrated and the particulars of the surface of integration.    For defined as the top half ( ) of the sphere of radius one centered at the origin, consider the surface integral .   zero   The scalar output of our function is given by the x-coordinate of the points on the hemisphere. Since the hemisphere is symmetric across the yz-plane, there will be exactly as much contribution from the side with positive x-coordinates as from the negative x-coordinates.    For defined as the bottom half ( ) of the sphere of radius one centered at the origin, consider the surface integral .   negative   For points on the bottom half of the sphere, the z-coordinate will be non-positive. So we will be accumulating negative (or zero) values over that hemisphere, which will cause our Riemann sum and corresponding scalar surface integral to be negative.    For defined as the disc of radius one centered at on the plane , consider the surface integral .   positive   We would separate into . Because we have x-coordinate of 1 for all points on , will be positive. Since the disc in will be symmetric across the xy-plane, will be zero because the accumluation of the z-coordinates will cancel out exactly in the Riemann sum. Thus the sum will be positive.    For as defined above, consider the surface integral .   positive   We would separate into . Because we have z-coordinate non-negative for all points on , will be positive. Since will be symmetric across the yz-plane, will be zero because the accumluation of the x-coordinates will cancel out exactly in the Riemann sum. Thus the sum will be positive.      Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation. If and are disjoint surfaces Technically, the surfaces may intersect, but there are restrictions on the manner in which they can intersect, and we will not go into the details here. , we denote by the surface containing every point that is in or . Also, if is a surface, then denotes the same surface but parameterized in such a way that the normal vector points in the opposite direction. The list below summarizes some other properties of scalar surface integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of other integrals we have studied.   Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , scalar valued functions and , and oriented surfaces and , the following properties hold:                          Explaining Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals   In this activity, we will be explaining each of the properties from in the context of a new analogy. We have just purchased a plot of land that spans two mountains, Sugar Mountain and Spice Mountain. We will label the plot of land on Sugar Mountain and the plot of land on Spice Mountain . Unfortunately there are two types of toxic organisms on the surface of your new land, which may explain why you paid so little for the land. Let be the density of the toxic fungus on your new plot of land and let be the density of toxic bacteria on the new plot.    Explain in your own words what means in the above analogy and what exactly would be measured by this scalar line integral.   Total amount of toxic fungus on Sugar Mountain.   The scalar surface integral would calculate the accumulation of toxic fungus on the Sugar Mountain part of your plot. In particular, measures the total amount of toxic fungus on your Sugar Mountain land.    Explain in your own words what means in the new analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   doubling density will double the total amount   If the density of toxic fungus on Sugar Mountain was to double, that would also double the total amount of toxic fungus on Sugar Mountain.    Explain in your own words what means in the new analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   Adding densities will correspond to adding total amounts   The total amount of toxic material on Spice Mountain can be calculated as the amount of toxic fungus on Spice Mountain plus the amount of toxic bacteria on Spice Mountain.    Explain in your own words what means in the new analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   Orientation does not change scalar surface integrals   The scalar surface integral will measure the amount of toxic fungus on Spice mountain when changing the orientation of the surface . The total amount of toxic fungus on a plot does not change if we change if we change what we define as the in\/out direction of the surface.    Explain in your own words what means in the new analogy. It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   Total amount of toxic fungus on the mountains is the sum on the individual mountains   The total amount of toxic fungus on Sugar Mountain and Spice Mountain is the sum of the amount of toxic fungus on Sugar Mountain plus the amount of toxic fungus on Spice Mountain.    We will conclude this section with one more example of computing a scalar surface integral and then an activity that asks you to compute one for yourself using a parameterization of a surface.   Let us return to one of the problems from . Specifically, we will compute the answer to part of that activity. We will compute where is the top half ( ) of the sphere of radius one centered at the origin. Thinking in terms of spherical coordinates is helpul for determining a parameterization of . Here we can use where and , which comes from thinking of and in spherical coordinates (and ). Using , we need to compute the partial derivatives of with respect to and , then compute . For our parameterization, we get The form given for is simplified. Before simplifying, we have . Note that , which means that because for any or and for .  We can now use to compute the scalar surface integral as .

Compute the value of the scalar surface integral in . That is, compute where is the disc of radius one centered at on the plane . Explain why your answer makes sense geometrically.         The surface can be parameterized by where and . Using , we need to compute the partial derivatives of with respect to and , then compute . For this parameterization, we have . Simplifying we have and thus , with no absolute values required here . This may be a familiar result from a change of coordinates between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates, .  We can now use to compute the scalar surface integral as .  This result should match your answer for part of since the output of the function equals . The values of will be symmetric but opposite in sign for the parts of the surface above and below the -plane. Thus the scalar surface integral will be one times the area of which gives the value .      Summary     Scalar surface integrals are defined in terms of double Riemann sums of the product of the value of a scalar-valued function at a point on the surface and the area patch of the tangent plane to the surface at that point.    A scalar surface integral measures the total accumulation of a scalar-valued function on the surface.    Scalar surface integrals can be efficiently computed by parameterizing the surface of integration as and then integrating , where is the domain of the parameterization.        This WebWork problem uses a slightly different notation which you might see in other sources. In this problem, the parameters used are and and the parameterization is given by . The tangent vectors created by taking partial derivatives are notated by and . and the normal vector to the surface is given by .    Show that parametrizes the plane . Then:  (a) Calculate , , and .

By we get: We use the substitution to compute the integral. This gives:          Evaluate where is the helicoid: , with              Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section relies parameterized surfaces, which was first introduced in . While some of the motivation for this section came from our treatment of flux integrals, it is not necessary to cover flux integrals first.   "

In short, the amount of copium mined depended on the density of copium at points on the path and the length of the path driven by the mining rig.   A plot of land with density of copium deposits and the edges of the plot drawn in yellow      The opening tasks of had you estimating the amount of copium mined by driving along the edge of a plot of land (drawn in yellow on ). This iterpretation meant that the scalar function we were using measured the linear density of copium. Thus, the Riemann sum we computed was the product of linear density of copium with the distance traveled.    In this task, we will interpret as a contour graph of the density of copium per unit area. This will allow us to compute the total amount of copium in our mining area by setting up a double integral. To approximate the total amount of copium available in our mine, do the following:   Break the mining plot (the area inside the yellow segments of ) into three pieces. Estimate the area of the three pieces you are using. Write a few sentences explaining your methods of estimating the areas.   For each of the three pieces you used in part , estimate the average density of copium on the piece. Write a few sentences explaining your methods of estimating the average density on each piece.   Give an estimate for the total amount of copium on the mining plot and explain your computation.          Cutting the region up into three pieces as shown with the plot above, we can estimate the areas and copium densities for each piece as follows:  The lower left triangle will have area of around 30,000 square meters and have a density of around 3.  The middle figure will have area of around 30,000 square meters and have a density of around 1.5.  The upper right triangle will have area of around 60,000 square meters and have a density of around 2.5.  Summing these area estimates times the densities will give a total estimate of 285,000. Your estimates will vary.    What if instead of your mining plot being on a flat piece of land as represented in , your mining plot was on a hill as represented in . If we had the same copium density plot as a function of the coordinates, which of the following would you expect to be true?  the total amount of copium available on is greater than on   the total amount of copium available on is lesser than on   the total amount of copium available on is the same as on   Explain your reasoning for your choice.   A 3D plot of the region including our mining area (shown with boundary in red)     The total amount of copium available on is greater than on    The total amount of copium available on is greater than on because the surface area of the region on the hill ( ) will be greater than the area of the corresponding flat parts of .

For our first part of our example, we use symmetry to reason about . Without using any calculations or parameterizations, we can reason that this scalar surface integral will be zero. In a scalar surface integral, we are calculating the accumulation of the scalar output over a surface area in space. In , you can see that we can symmetrically break our surface into two regions that have exactly the same surface area properties and symmetric output values for our scalar function, . Here we denote by the portion of with (colored green), while is the magenta portion of the surface, which has . The only difference between the green and magenta portions of that is relevant to our surface integral is that the values of will be positive on the green surface and negative on the magenta surface No matter how we break up the Riemann sum or the corresponding scalar surface integral for the green side of our surface, applying the same pattern to the magenta side will give the same result but with an opposite sign. In other words, .   The surface divided into regions with positive -coordinate in green and with negative -coordinate in red    Therefore, .    From a calculation standpoint, we can verify this result using our parameterization from in . Specifically, we will use the parameterization of given by with bounds and . We also know from that .

Only the bounds on the integral will change since we are using the same parameterization and function from the previous part. We can use the parameterization given by with and . As before, . Thus, gives .  It makes sense that the result of is positive because the output of our function is non-negative for all points on . Remember that the Riemann sum used in calculating surface integrals of scalar functions is the product of the function's value on each piece times the estimate of the surface area. Thus, if the function's value is positive for all points on the surface, then the scalar surface integral will also be positive.   "

We can reuse the parameterization and calculations from above for here and move directly to setting up the iterated integral. We will take a moment here to note that converting our scalar function to a function of and will give . Therefore, we have the following iterated integral, which we evaluate:   This result is a bit more difficult to to make sense of as being negative. In , we have a plot of the surface in blue and the parabolic cylinder surface given by is plotted in yellow. The points on the yellow surface correspond to where our scalar function ( ) gives an output of zero. The points inside the parabolic cylinder have a -coordinate greater than , which means that will have a positive output for these points. The points outside of the parabolic cylinder have a -coordinate less than , which means that will have a negative output for these points. In order to make an argument about whether is positive, negative, or zero, we will need to assess whether there is more surface area where takes on positive values, more with negative values, or an equal amount of positive-negative values. Actually, our problem is even harder than this! Beacuse the Riemann sum is the product of the output for each piece of our surface times the surface area estimate, we will need to think about which points\/pieces have larger or smaller outputs for . This is very difficult in general, because we need a systematic way of estimating both the output of and the surface area of different pieces of the surface.   The surface is plotted with the surface given by    In our case, there is more surface area of inside the parabolic cylinder than outside. For points that are far away from the yellow surface, the magnitude of the value of for that point will be large. For points that are close to the yellow surface, the -coordinates are close to , and thus values of are close to zero. This means that in order to properly estimate the scalar surface integral, we must assess whether there is a greater weighted surface area inside the parabolic cylinder than outside, where the weight of each surface area piece is given by how far the piece is from the yellow parabolic cylinder. This is not an easy argument to make, and is not easy to verify visually for this example.

Why does the flux integral of through a surface with boundary only depend on the boundary of the surface and not the shape of the surface's interior?      When we studied in , we saw how integrating the circulation density over a region in the plane bounded by a simple closed curve is equivalent to calculating the circulation along the boundary curve. When we consider simple closed curves in , the situation gets more complicated. However, there is an interesting, and perhaps surprising, generalization of for us to examine.

Substituting gives the following equations:  by trig identity           Circulation in three dimensions and Stokes' Theorem  In , we saw that a simple closed curve in can bound many different surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface in that has a well-defined normal vector at every point and a boundary curve . We will use the normal vector to define an orientation of so that if a person were to walk along in the direction of the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the direction of , their left arm would be over the surface . Notice that this is the same convention that we used with if we assume that the normal vector being used is .  In , we show the curve from in magenta as well as a surface that has as its boundary. The chosen normal vector to is shown, as is the orientation of that matches .   A surface (and normal vector) bounded by an oriented simple closed curve    Thinking back to , our main idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple closed curve in by taking the double integral of the circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw in , we can break up into line integrals around other simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green's Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green's Theorem, we require that a simple closed curve in three dimensions bound a smooth surface with a normal vector . In doing this, we can choose our smaller curves similar to the squares we used in Green's Theorem to lie on the surface . This gives us almost all the ingredients used in Green's Theorem, but we still need to find a suitable replacement for the circulation density.  As we saw in , the curl of a vector field in measures the rotation of the vector field. says that for a unit vector , the scalar measures the rotational strength of at the point around the axis defined by . When is the normal vector to the surface at the point , we have the appropriate analog for the circulation density of on at . Thus, the equivalent idea to integrating the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field over a region in the plane is calculating the flux integral , where on the domain that gives a parameterization of the smooth surface .  A rigorous proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of this text. However, and our discussion of provide an intuitive description of why this theorem is true.   Stokes' Theorem   Let be a smooth surface in with a simple closed curve as its boundary. Let be a vector field that is smooth on and . Suppose that on the domain gives a parametrization of for which is oriented so that a person walking along in the direction of its orientation and head pointing in the direction of the normal vector would have their left hand above . In this setting, the circulation of along is equal to the flux of through . That is, .      Verifying and Applying Stokes' Theorem  In this subsection, we will look at some examples and activities that will verify Stokes' Theorem by calculation both side for a few different situations.    In this example, we will verify Stoke's Theorem for the curve used in using the parameterization and surfaces from . We will use the vector field throughout this problem.    We first calculate the circulation of around the curve with parameterization given by with . Note here that . Applying to calculate the circulation, we have If you were to write out this dot product and combine like terms, then you would be left with four terms. Each of these can be evaluated using a few trig identities and substitutions. In fact, three of the four terms will correspond to functions that have as much area below the axis as above and thus will have integrals of zero. The circulation of around is . This result being negative means that more of the vector field moves opposite the direction of travel given by the parameterization.    In this part, we will calculate the flux of through a surface with boundary . As demonstrated by , there are several different surfaces that we can use in this problem. For our first case, we will use the part of the surface that is bounded by as shown in . This surface can be parameterized by with and .   A portion of the surface bounded by    Using our parameterization, we have the following for the partial derivative functions and the corresponding normal vector: In particular, our parameterization yields . Since we used polar coordinates as our parameter, .   If you completed of , you may recognize our cacluation of as fitting the following form: If , then is of the form .   The next step in setting up the flux integral on the right side of Stokes' Theorem is calculating the curl of . Since , and converting to and gives . Now we are able to apply , which give the following iterated integral: . Evaluating this dot product and computing each integral gives , which matches our result for the calculation of the circulation around .    As we saw in there is more than one surface that has as a boundary. We will calculate the flux integral (the right side of Stokes' Theorem) for a different surface to help motivate why it will not matter which surface we use (as long as we have the correct orientation and boundary). For this part we will use the surface , which will be parameterized by with and . Additionally, we will use the trig identity to write the last component of our parameterization as .  Using our parameterization, we have the following for the partial derivative functions and the corresponding normal vector: (There are a number of equivalent algebraic simpmlifications that can be done here by choosing different trigonometric identities.)  Now we are ready to set up the flux integral as the following iterated integral: You probably noticed that this integral looks slightly more complicated than our work in the previous part, but if we are consistent, we should get the same result. Evaluating this dot product and computing each integral gives . Because both sine and cosine will integrate to zero over the interval from to , we only need to evaluate , which gives exactly the same result as our circulation integral and our flux integral with the other surface.    We close this subsection with a pair of activities. The first focuses on calculating both of the integrals in . The second asks you to calculate some line integrals along simple closed curves and gives you the discretion to choose the best method to use for this (as well as the best surface to use, if you choose Stokes' Theorem).    In this activity, we will verify by calculating both a line integral and a flux integral.    Consider the vector field and the circle parameterized as for .   Calculate directly using the given parametrization.   0   Using the vector field and the given parameterization, we get the following circulation calculation:    Let be the hemisphere of the sphere of radius centered at the origin with . Calculate the flux of through .   0   Because the curl of is , the flux of the curl through will be zero.   What could you have observed about that would have gotten you the same answer without doing either of the above calculations?    is a conservative vector field   The vector field is conservative because where . The circulation of a conservative vector field over a closed loop is always zero.    Consider the vector field and the curve , which is the triangle with vertices , , and with orientation corresponding to the order the points are listed here.   Find the circulation of along by calculating the appropriate line integrals.       We parameterize the boundary triangle with the following elements:           with . These parameterizations have derivatives of , , and . This gives the circulation integral as which will simplify to which evaluates to .   The vertices of lie in a plane. Let be the portion of this plane lying in the first octant, i.e., the portion with . Find the flux of through .       The curl of is and the surface is parameterized by with and . This give the flux integral of    Write a sentence to explain why the sign of your answer to the previous two parts makes sense.   The flux is negative because the curl of is pointing in the opposite direction of the outward pointing normal vector for .   The flux is negative because the curl of is pointing in the opposite direction of the outward pointing normal vector for .      Find the circulation of along the curve consisting of (given in order of the orientation) the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , the line segment from to , the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and the line segment from to .       For the vector field , we get a curl of . The surface we will use is parameterized by with and . So the flux integral of the curl of through our surface is given by     Find the circulation of along the circle in the -plane of radius centered at the origin. Assume the counterclockwise orientation of the circle.       For the vector field , the curl is given by . We will use the disc of radius 3 in the xy-plane centered at the origin for our surface, with normal vector . Thus the flux through our surface will be two times the area of the surface, .    In part , there are two reasonable choices for the surface bounded by the circle. If you did not do so while doing the activity, we encourage you to identify both of them and compare which one makes doing the flux integral easier. In general, this will vary depending on the curl of the vector field in question, so we cannot give a rule for determining what surface or coordinate system to use. However, we do encourage you to think about which surface will make evaluating the flux integral easiest.    Practice with Surfaces and their Boundaries  When we looked , it was generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the circumstances described in and of , we did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector field. The situation for will be similar, with the exception of in this section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional piece of freedom: selecting the surface through which we calculate the flux of from amongst possibly several reasonable surfaces with boundary . The next two activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their boundary.    Because requires us to consider a surface (with normal vector) and the boundary of the surface, this activity will give you a chance to practice identifying the boundary of some surfaces in . For each surface below:  Describe the boundary in words.  Find a parametrization for the boundary.  Ensure that a person walking along the boundary in the direction of your parametrization with head pointing in the direction of the surface's normal vector would hold their left hand over the surface.      The surface is the portion of the sphere with . Assume the outward orientation on the sphere.     The boundary is the circle on the plane of radius 2, centered at the origin.   with   yes       The boundary is the circle on the plane of radius 2, centered at the origin.   with   Using the right hand rule on this orientation will show that the circulation on the boundary will be measured with the positive z-component (corresponding to the outward normal of the sphere)      The surface is the portion of the sphere with . Assume the outward orientation on the sphere.

Assume the upward orientation, e.g., the normal vector at is .     The boundary is the path that sits above the circle of radius 1 in the xy-plane centered at the origin, but has z-coordinate given by .   with   yes       The boundary is the path that sits above the circle of radius 1 in the xy-plane centered at the origin, but has z-coordinate given by .   with   Using the right hand rule on this orientation will show that the circulation on the boundary will be measured with the positive z-component (corresponding to the outward normal of the saddle surface)      The surface is the portion of the cylinder for which , assuming the outward orientation.   It is fine for the boundary of a surface to be made up of more than one curve. Think carefully about how each piece is oriented!     The boundary is given by the curve consisting of (given in order of the orientation) the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , the line segment from to , the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and the line segment from to .   with the first and third having and the second and fourth having .  yes       The boundary is given by the curve consisting of (given in order of the orientation) the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , the line segment from to , the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and the line segment from to .   with the first and third having and the second and fourth having .  Using the right hand rule on this orientation will show that the circulation on the boundary will be measured in the radially outward direction (away from the z-axis        In some sense, this activity considers the reverse problem of that considered in . Here, each part of the activity gives you an oriented simple closed curve in , and your task is to find  a surface so that is the boundary of and  a normal vector for the so that a person walking along in the direction of the given orientation with head pointing in the direction of your chosen normal vector would have their left hand over .  You are encouraged to think about multiple possible answers, since as we saw in , there may be more than one reasonable choice of a surface with a particular boundary.    The curve is the triangle with vertices , , and with orientation corresponding to the order the points are listed here.       A surface with given boundary could be and the normal vector would be .    The curve is the circle parameterized as for .       A surface with given boundary could be (for ) the normal vector would be radially outward from the origin.    The curve consists of (given in order of the orientation)  the quarter-circle of radius centered at the origin in the -plane from to ,  the line segment from to ,  the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and  the line segment from to .      for     for with normal vector pointing away from the z-axis.      Summary      tells us that we can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field along a simple closed curve in that bounds a surface (with normal vector) on which the vector field is also smooth by calculating the flux of the curl of the vector field through the surface.    Given two surfaces and with the same boundary (and assuming normal vectors that give the same orientation on ), the flux of through and through is the same because tells us that this flux is equal to the circulation of along .         Find where is a circle of radius in the plane , centered at and oriented clockwise when viewed from the origin, if          writing for the disk in the plane enclosed by the circle, Stokes' Theorem gives Now , where is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane and an area element on the plane, so , and         Use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate where and is the boundary of the part of the paraboloid where which lies above the xy-plane and is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above.               Verify Stokes' theorem for the helicoid where lies in the rectangle , and is the vector field .  First, compute the surface integral:  , where  , , , , and   (use \"t\" for theta).  Finally, the value of the surface integral is .  Next compute the line integral on that part of the boundary from to .  , where  , , and   (use \"t\" for theta).                                                      is generally used to turn a line integral into a flux integral. Sometimes it is possible to be given a flux integral and recognize that the given vector field is for some vector field , however. When this is the case, we call a vector potential for the vector field , much like a function so that is called a potential function for .   Find a vector field so that .   Your experience in finding potential functions for gradient vector fields will be useful to you here, although you will have more flexibility.           When finding an anti-derivative of a function of a single variable, you know that there is an infinite family of anti-derivatives, but that any two anti-derivatives differ by a constant. This is why we write expressions such as . A similar phenomenon occurs with (scalar) potential functions for gradient vector fields. Find a second vector field with the same curl as in part , and do so in a way that is not a constant vector. That is, after simplifying fully, must contain at least one of the variables .           Verify that for the vector fields you found above, is a gradient vector field. Explain why for every pair of vector potentials for a vector field , you must have that is a gradient vector field.   If , then .   If , then . So, .   Explain why if is a vector field with a vector potential , . Such a vector field is called a solenoidal vector field or divergence-free vector field .   If , then .   If , then . So, .     For each of the following vector fields, determine whether a vector potential exists. If so, find one.  For this problem, enter your vectors with angle-bracket notation: , not in -notation.  (a)      has a vector potential    does not have a vector potential    ,   (If there is no potential function, enter none for the function.)  (b)      has a vector potential    does not have a vector potential    ,  (If there is no potential function, enter none for the function.)                       (a) Since , we know that has a vector potential. One such is the vector field , but there are many others. (b) Since , we know that does not have a vector potential.       Repeat the steps of and with the surface to verify Stokes' Theorem for another different surface. Your flux integral should calculate to as in .     Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section relies heavily on understanding flux integrals as well as the calculation of circulation around a closed curve (from and ). gives some reminders about the different ways to parameterize surfaces, which was first introduced in .

  "body": " The Divergence Theorem     What is a closed surface in ?    How can we efficiently calculate the flux through a closed surface in when that surface must be parametrized in several pieces?       In we examined vector fields to consider how the strength of a vector field changes in different regions. In particular, we developed the divergence of a vector field as a local measurement (based on density) of how the strength of the vector field changes. In particular, we did this by looking at the flux of the vector field through a closed path in two dimensions and then generalized these ideas to higher dimensions.  In , we measured how much of a vector field flowed through a section of a surface in three dimensions as a generalization of our argument from . In this section, we will connect the ideas of flux of a vector field through a closed surface in three dimensions and the divergence of that vector field.  Recalling the surfaces we studied in , where we applied , notice that all of these surfaces had the property that they had a boundary along which we calculated circulation. It turns out that giving a precise definition for boundary is challenging. For our purposes, however, you might think of a boundary curve of a surface as being a curve along which you could walk with your arms stretched out on either side with one arm lying over the surface and the other arm not lying over the surface as you walk. In this section, we will study closed surfaces in three dimensions, which are those surfaces without boundary. In , none of the surfaces were closed, because each had a boundary curve. On the other hand, in , we show two more surfaces that are not closed, as demonstrated by the magenta curves marking the edge where the surface ends.   Two surfaces that are not closed    In fact, the yellow cylinder has two edges where the surface ends (does not meet itself). The surfaces in  are closed because there is no edge to the surface. Note that the cylinder has been filled in with a cap at top and bottom (plotted in gray and green, respectively) to become a closed surface.   Two closed surfaces    Closed surfaces can be used to define the boundary of a volume in space. If we have the top and bottom on our cylinder, we have a well-defined volume of space, in that we know which points are inside the volume and which are outside of the volume. With different top and bottom surfaces, the enclosed volume would be different. illustrates three different ways to complete the cylindrical surface into a closed surface.   Three ways to close a cylindrical surface by adding a top and bottom     Locating sources of a poisonous gas   We will use three different surfaces to examine the flux through closed surfaces. Let be the top half of the unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in magenta in the figures below). Let be the bottom half of the unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in yellow). Finally, let be the unit disk centered at the origin in the -plane (graphed in blue). With these definitions, and will make a closed surface given by the unit sphere. The surfaces and will enclose the top half of the unit ball, while and will enclose the bottom half of the unit ball.  In this problem we will be using the surfaces defined above and the flux integrals of a poisonous gas through these surfaces to try to determine whether different regions of space are emitting or absorbing the poisonous gas.    In this part, we will consider the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. If the flux integral of a poisonous gas through is and the flux integral of the poison gas through is , is the interior of the sphere emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.   Unit ball with boundary given by the combination of and     12   Because the flux through the sphere can be calculuated as the flux through the top plus the flux through the bottom, .    In this part, we will consider the top half of the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. If the flux integral of a poisonous gas through is and the flux integral of the poison gas through is , is the top half of the unit ball emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.   Upper half of the unit ball with boundaries given by and     absorbing   Because the total flux through the top and the middle surfaces is -5, there is more of the gas entering this volume than is leaving the volume. Thus this volume is absorbing poison gas.    In this part, we will consider the bottom half of the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. Based on the information given in the previous two parts, what will the flux integrals of the poison gas be for and be in this case? Be sure to pay attention to the orientation of what we consider positive flow. Explain your reasoning.   Lower half of the unit ball with boundaries given by and     17   The flux through the bottom hemisphere and the middle disk will be the sum of the flux through the bottom surface and the flux through the middle disk. We know the flux through the middle disk is -20 when considering the outward pointing normal having a negative z-component, so the outward flux for this part will be (positive) 20. Thus the totaal flux will be .    Using your answer from the previous part, is the bottom half of the unit ball emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.   emitting   Because there is a net flux going out of the region, the region is emitting poison gas.    The preview activity showed how the flux through a closed surface can be subdivided into the flux through surfaces which combine to be the closed surface (with orientation switches corresponding to additive inverse). The net flux through the closed surface measures the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed on the interior of the closed surface.    The Divergence Theorem  The divergence of a vector field was developed as a measurement of the density with which the strength of vector field is changing. In three dimensions, the divergence measures the density per unit volume in which the vector field is being created or destroyed. This means that if we integrate the divergence of a vector field over a volume of space, we will get the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed in that particular volume of space. Since the net amount of a vector field that is created or destroyed in a volume of space is the same as the net flux of the vector field through the closed surface that is the boundary of that volume, we have a correspondence between a triple integral of the divergence of a vector field on the interior of a closed surface and the flux integral of the vector field over the closed surface.   Divergence Theorem   Let be a closed surface in three dimensional space and let be the volume bounded by . If is a vector field that has continuous first partial derivatives on and , then where the integral on the left measures the flux through in terms of the outward pointing normal vector.    The preview activity and the discussion before the statement of the have hopefully given you some intuition as to why the theorem is true. The ideas should also seem similar to the manner in which we approached and . In the next example, we will verify the Divergence Theorem for a particular case.    In this example we will apply the to the vector field and the region in the first octant bounded above by . We will go through the calculations of the flux integral on the right side and the triple integral on the left side.   We first calculate the left side of the Divergence Theorem using four flux integrals (one for each of the four boundary surfaces) as illustrated in . We will need to parametrize each of the four faces which we will call (in magenta), (in yellow), (in blue), and (in green). where all of these parameterization use and . These parameterizations have the corresponding normal vectors: Notice that and point into while and point out of . We will take into account the idea that we will need to calculate the flow out of when we sum our flux integrals later.  The region of integration with each of the four faces in a different color.   We set up and evaluate each of these flux integrals using : A strategy we can use to make our calculations more efficient is to note that we can subtract the first and third integrals from the second and fourth (remember the direction of flux) and do one integral. We can do this because the bounds on all of our parameterizations is the same. If we write out everything, we have: Combining these we have: which evaluates to .  Next, we calculate the triple integral on the right side of the Divergence Theorem for our example. Since , we can calculate The region can be described by the bounds , , and . Thus, our triple integral will be set up and evaluated as This evaluates to , which matches with the flux calculations we did in the previous step to verify the Divergence Theorem for our example.   The next activity walks you through evaluating both the flux integrals necessary to calculate the flux directly and the triple integral given in the for a specific vector field and closed surface.    In this activity, we will look at calculating both sides of a non-trivial example of the . We will look at the region inside the right circular cylinder shown in . Let be the closed surface formed by combining (in yellow), (in blue), and (in magenta). The solid volume is the volume bounded by . The region shown has radius , and its height is . The vector field we consider in this activity is given by .   A closed cylindrical surface       shows the vector field on a region around . Without doing any computations, write a couple of sentences to explain if you think the flux of through will be positive, negative, or zero.   The vector field in the region near     positive   There appears to be more of the vector field going out of the top surface than is going into the bottom. There appears to be the same amount of flow into the side as out of the side surface.    Parametrize each of the surfaces , , and . Be sure to give bounds for each of your parametrization.      for and    for and    for and         for and    for and    for and       Give inequalities in terms of cylindrical coordinates to describe .            Set up and evaluate double integrals to calculate the flux of through , , and .       Setting up flux integrals for each side will give you: for the top, for the bottom, and for the side.    What is the net flux through the closed surface? Be sure to state if the net flux is in or out.       The total flux is .    Compute the divergence of and use this to explain whether you think will be positive, negative, or zero.    , positive    The triple integral of will be positive because the z values will be positive and the y-values will sum to zero over the region.    Set up and compute the triple integral for .  Use cylindrical coordinates.           Verify that your answers for part and part are the same and thus that the Divergence Theorem holds for this example.    Was the left-hand side or right-hand side of the equation in the Divergence Theorem more tedious to calculate in this example? Do you think this will be true for most other cases where the Divergence Theorem applies?   The triple integral is much easier to calculate.   The triple integral is much easier to calculate.    The next activity asks you to compute flux in some circumstances where it may be wise to apply .    Find the flux of the vector field through the surface of the solid cube in with , , and .   64   For , . So the divergence theorem gives the following triple integral:     Find the flux of the vector field through surface consisting of the top half of sphere of radius centered at the origin and the disc of radius in the -plane (centered at the origin).   Spherical coordinates       For , . So the divergence theorem gives the following triple integral:       Summary     A closed surface is one that has no boundary.    The flux of a smooth vector field through a closed surface can be computed by integrating the divergence of the vector field over the volume bounded by the closed surface.         Verify the Divergence Theorem for the vector field and region:  and the region ,                 With Let be the surface of the cylinder and the region enclosed by . We compute the two sides of the Divergence Theorem: We first calculate the surface integral. Step 1. Integral over the side of the cylinder. The side of the cylinder is parametrized by  Then, We obtain the integral  Step 2. Integral over the top of the cylinder. The top of the cylinder is parametrized by with parameter domain . The upward pointing normal is Also, Hence, The last integral is zero due to symmetry.  Step 3. Integral over the bottom of the cylinder. We parametrize the bottom by The downward pointing normal is . Then We obtain the following integral, which is zero due to symmetry: Adding the integrals we get  Step 4. Compare with integral of divergence.  The equality of and verifies the Divergence Theorem.        Use the divergence theorem to calculate the flux of the vector field out of the closed, outward-oriented surface bounding the solid                Let . Evaluate for each of the following regions :  A.    B.    C.                          Compute the flux integral in two ways, directly and using the Divergence Theorem. is the surface of the box with faces , closed and oriented outward, and .  Using the Divergence Theorem,    ,  where , , , , and .  Next, calculating directly, we have (the sum of the flux through each of the six faces of the box). Calculating the flux through each face separately, we have:  On ,   =  where , , and .  On ,   =  where , , and .  On ,   =  where , , and .  On ,   =  where , , and .  On ,   =  where , , and .

Thus, summing these, we have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So, if is the interior of the box, we have Integrating through each of the integrals in turn, we have      Finding flux directly, note that on the faces and the normal vectors to the surfaces are and respectively, so that (where is evaluated at 4 or 1), and similarly on and , and and , and , respectively. Thus on and the flux is zero. On the remaining faces, we have (1) On , ; (2) On , ; (3) On , ; and (4) On , . Thus the total flux is the sum of these, .       Let be the volume enclosed by , , , , , and . Compute the flux of through each of the six cube faces.       The triple integral calculation would be     Let be the volume given in cylindrical coordinates by , , and . Give an example of a vector field with component functions that are linear in , , and such that the flux of the vector field through the boundary of is 17.       If , then . Since we have a constant divergence and the volume of the region is , the triple integral of the divergence over the region will result in 25.    Let be the volume given in spherical coordinates by , , and . Give an example of a vector field with component functions that are not linear or constant such that the flux of the vector field through the boundary of is 25.       We suggest a method like the the one done below but there are many possible answers. We will make a vector field of the form which will have divergence of . Thus the divergence theorem shos that the flux through our surface will be the same as the triple integral. If we want the result to be 25, then we can use .    Calculate the flux of the given vector field through the surface for each situation below by using an appropriate triple integral from the Divergence Theorem.   The vector field through the tetrahedron with vertices , , , and .       Using the divergence theorem and the fact that the divergence of our vector field is will mean that the flux through our surfaces can be calculated by the following triple integral    The vector field through , the portion of the sphere of radius centered at the origin having .   By itself, is not a closed surface. However, you should think about what additional surface you need to add to make a closed surface, then use those pieces to apply the Divergence Theorem.       We can use the disc of radius 3 centered at the origin on the plane to make a closed region. There will be no flux through this disc because when our vector field will have a zero first component. Only the first component will correspond to flux through the disc. Using the divergence theorem and the fact that the divergence of our vector field is will mean that the flux through our surfaces can be calculated by the following triple integral      Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section relies heavily on understanding flux integrals as well as the meaning of the divergence of a vector field from and triple integrals from .
