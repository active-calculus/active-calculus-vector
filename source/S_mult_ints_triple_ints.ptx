    </objectives>

    <introduction>
    <p>
      We have now learned that we define the double integral of a continuous function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> over a rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> as a limit of a double Riemann sum, and that these ideas parallel the single-variable integral of a function <m>g = g(x)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Moreover, this double integral has natural interpretations and applications, and can even be considered over non-rectangular regions, <m>D</m>. For instance, given a continuous function <m>f</m> over a region <m>D</m>, the average value of <m>f</m>, <m>f_{\operatorname{AVG}(D)}</m>, is given by
      <me>
        f_{\operatorname{AVG}(D)} = \frac{1}{A(D)} \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA,
      </me>
      where <m>A(D)</m> is the area of <m>D</m>. Likewise, if <m>\delta(x,y)</m> describes a mass density function on a lamina over <m>D</m>, the mass, <m>M</m>, of the lamina is given by
      <me>
        M = \iint_D \delta(x,y) \, dA.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is natural to wonder if it is possible to extend these ideas of double Riemann sums and double integrals for functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums and then triple integrals for functions of three variables. We begin investigating in <xref ref="PA_11_7">Preview Activity</xref>.

        Consider a solid piece of granite in the shape of a box <m>B = \{(x,y,z) : 0 \leq x \leq 4, 0 \leq y \leq 6, 0 \leq z \leq 8\}</m>, whose density varies from point to point. Let <m>\delta(x, y, z)</m> represent the mass density of the piece of granite at point <m>(x,y,z)</m> in kilograms per cubic meter (so we are measuring <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> in meters). Our goal is to find the mass of this solid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recall that if the density was constant, we could find the mass by multiplying the density and volume; since the density varies from point to point, we will use the approach we did with two-variable lamina problems, and slice the solid into small pieces on which the density is roughly constant.

  <subsection>
    <title>Triple Riemann Sums and Triple Integrals</title>
    <p>
      Through the application of a mass density distribution over a three-dimensional solid, <xref ref="PA_11_7">Preview Activity</xref> suggests that the generalization from double Riemann sums of functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums of functions of three variables is natural. In the same way, so is the generalization from double integrals to triple integrals. By simply adding a <m>z</m>-coordinate to our earlier work, we can define both a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral.
    </p>


    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f = f(x,y,z)</m> be a continuous function on a box <m>B = [a,b] \times [c,d] \times [r,s]</m>. The <term>triple Riemann sum of <m>f</m> over <m>B</m></term><idx><h>triple Riemann sum</h></idx> is created as follows.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>m</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{m}</m>. Let <m>x_0</m>, <m>x_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_m</m> be the endpoints of these subintervals, where <m>a = x_0\lt x_1\lt x_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  x_m = b</m>.
                Do likewise with the interval <m>[c,d]</m> using <m>n</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta y = \frac{d-c}{n}</m> to generate <m>c = y_0\lt y_1\lt y_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  y_n = d</m>, and with the interval <m>[r,s]</m> using <m>\ell</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta z = \frac{s-r}{\ell}</m> to have <m>r = z_0\lt z_1\lt z_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  z_l = s</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Let <m>B_{ijk}</m> be the sub-box of <m>B</m> with opposite vertices <m>(x_{i-1},y_{j-1},z_{k-1})</m> and <m>(x_i, y_j, z_k)</m> for <m>i</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>m</m>, <m>j</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>n</m>, and <m>k</m> between 1 and <m>\ell</m>. The volume of each <m>B_{ijk}</m> is <m>\Delta V = \Delta x \cdot \Delta y \cdot \Delta z</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Let <m>(x_{ijk}^*, y_{ijk}^*, z_{ijk}^*)</m> be a point in box <m>B_{ijk}</m> for each <m>i</m>, <m>j</m>, and <m>k</m>. The resulting triple Riemann sum for <m>f</m> on <m>B</m> is
                <me>
                  \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^{\ell} f(x_{ijk}^*, y_{ijk}^*, z_{ijk}^*) \cdot \Delta V.
                </me>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      If <m>f(x,y,z)</m> represents the mass density of the box <m>B</m>, then, as we saw in <xref ref="PA_11_7">Preview Activity</xref>, the triple Riemann sum approximates the total mass of the box <m>B</m>. In order to find the exact mass of the box, we need to let the number of sub-boxes increase without bound (in other words, let <m>m</m>, <m>n</m>, and <m>\ell</m> go to infinity); in this case, the finite sum of the mass approximations becomes the actual mass of the solid <m>B</m>. More generally, we have the following definition of the triple integral.
    </p>


    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          With following notation defined as in a triple Riemann sum, the <term>triple integral of <m>f</m> over <m>B</m></term><idx><h>triple integral</h></idx> is
          <me>
            \iiint_B f(x,y,z) \, dV = \lim_{m,n,\ell \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^{\ell} f(x_{ijk}^*, y_{ijk}^*, z_{ijk}^*) \cdot \Delta V.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      As we noted earlier, if <m>f(x, y, z)</m> represents the density of the solid <m>B</m> at each point <m>(x, y, z)</m>, then
      <me>
        M = \iiint_B f(x,y,z) \, dV
      </me>
      is the mass of <m>B</m>.<idx><h>mass</h><h>of a solid</h></idx> Even more importantly, for any continuous function <m>f</m> over the solid <m>B</m>, we can use a triple integral to determine the average value of <m>f</m> over <m>B</m>, <m>f_{\operatorname{AVG}(B)}</m>. We note this generalization of our work with functions of two variables along with several others in the following important boxed information. Note that each of these quantities may actually be considered over a general domain <m>S</m> in <m>\R^3</m>, not simply a box, <m>B</m>.

            where <m>V(S)</m> is the volume of the solid <m>S</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>center of mass</em><idx><h>center of mass</h><h>of a solid</h></idx> of the solid <m>S</m> with density <m>\delta = \delta(x,y,z)</m> is <m>(\overline{x}, \overline{y}, \overline{z})</m>, where

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Cartesian coordinate system, the volume element <m>dV</m> is <m>dz \, dy \, dx</m>, and, as a consequence, a triple integral of a function <m>f</m> over a box <m>B = [a,b] \times [c,d] \times [r,s]</m> in Cartesian coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral of the form
      <me>
        \iiint_B f(x,y,z) \, dV = \int_a^b \int_c^d \int_r^s f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we want to evaluate a triple integral as an iterated integral over a solid <m>S</m> that is not a box, then we need to describe the solid in terms of variable limits.

                Finally, now that we have thought about slicing up the two-dimensional domain that is the projection of the cone, what are the limits on <m>z</m> in the innermost integral? Note that over any point <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane, a vertical slice in the <m>z</m> direction will involve a range of values from the cone itself to its flat top.  In particular, observe that at least one of these limits is not constant but depends on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

      <em>Note well: </em> When setting up iterated integrals, the limits on a given variable can be <em>only</em> in terms of the remaining variables. In addition, there are multiple different ways we can choose to set up such an integral. For example, two possibilities for iterated integrals that represent a triple integral <m>\iiint_S f(x,y,z) \, dV</m> over a solid <m>S</m> are
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \int_{h_1(x,y)}^{h_2(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_r^s \int_{p_1(z)}^{p_2(z)} \int_{q_1(x,z)}^{q_2(x,z)} f(x,y,z) \, dy \, dx \, dz</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      where <m>g_1</m>, <m>g_2</m>, <m>h_1</m>, <m>h_2</m>, <m>p_1</m>, <m>p_2</m>, <m>q_1</m>, and <m>q_2</m> are functions of the indicated variables. There are four other options beyond the two stated here, since the variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> can (theoretically) be arranged in any order. Of course, in many circumstances, an insightful choice of variable order will make it easier to set up an iterated integral, just as was the case when we worked with double integrals.

          </me>
          where <m>S</m> is the solid tetrahedron described above. In this example, we choose to integrate with respect to <m>z</m> first for the innermost integral. The top of the tetrahedron is given by the equation
          <me>
            x + 2 y + 3 z = 6;

          solving for <m>z</m> then yields

          The bottom of the tetrahedron is the <m>xy</m>-plane, so the limits on <m>z</m> in the iterated integral will be <m>0 \leq z \leq \frac{1}{3}(6-x-2y)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the bounds on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> we project the tetrahedron onto the <m>xy</m>-plane; this corresponds to setting <m>z = 0</m> in the equation <m>z = \frac{1}{3}(6 - x - 2y)</m>. The resulting relation between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is
          <me>

          If we choose to integrate with respect to <m>y</m> for the middle integral in the iterated integral, then the lower limit on <m>y</m> is the <m>x</m>-axis and the upper limit is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Note that the hypotenuse joins the points <m>(6,0)</m> and <m>(0,3)</m> and so has equation <m>y = 3 - \frac{1}{2}x</m>. Thus, the bounds on <m>y</m> are <m>0 \leq y \leq 3 - \frac{1}{2}x</m>. Finally, the <m>x</m> values run from 0 to 6, so the iterated integral that gives the mass of the tetrahedron is

      Setting up limits on iterated integrals can require considerable geometric intuition. It is important to not only create carefully labeled figures, but also to think about how we wish to slice the solid. Further, note that when we say <q>we will integrate first with respect to <m>x</m>,</q> by <q>first</q> we are referring to the innermost integral in the iterated integral. The next activity explores several different ways we might set up the integral in the preceding example.

                  \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{-\sqrt{2-x^2}}^{\sqrt{2-x^2}} \int_{x^2+y^2}^{8-3x^2-3y^2} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dz \, dy \, dx
                </me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If we interchange the orders of <m>y</m> and <m>x</m>,
                then symmetry shows that the mass of the solid is given by
                <me>
                  \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{-\sqrt{2-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2-y^2}} \int_{x^2+y^2}^{8-3x^2-3y^2} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dz \, dx \, dy
                </me>.
                To integrate with respect to <m>y</m> first,
                notice that the limits on <m>y</m> will vary depending on the height.
                If <m>0 \leq z \leq 2</m>,
                then the limits on <m>y</m> are determined by the paraboloid <m>z = x^2+y^2</m>.
                In this case we have <m>-\sqrt{z-x^2} \leq y \leq \sqrt{z-x^2}</m>.
                When we project this part of the surface onto the <m>x</m>-<m>z</m> plane,
                the result is the parabola <m>z=x^2</m>.
                We want the region above this parabola and below <m>z=2</m>.
                If <m>2 \leq z \leq 8</m>,
                then the limits on <m>y</m> are determined by the paraboloid <m>z = 8-3x^2-3y^2</m>.
                In this case we have <m>-\sqrt{8-z-3x^2} \leq y \leq \sqrt{8-z-3x^2}</m>.
                When we project this part of the surface onto the <m>x</m>-<m>z</m> plane,
                the result is the parabola <m>z=8-3x^2</m>.
                We want the region below this parabola and above <m>z=2</m>.
                So the mass of the solid is given by
                <me>
                  \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{x^2}^{2} \int_{-\sqrt{z-x^2}}^{\sqrt{z-x^2}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dy \, dz \, dx + \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{2}^{8-3x^2} \int_{-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3x^2)}}^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3x^2)}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dy \, dz \, dx
                </me>.
                Interchanging the orders of <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> shows that the mass of the solid is given by
                <me>
                  \int_{0}^{2} \int_{-\sqrt{z}}^{\sqrt{z}} \int_{-\sqrt{z-x^2}}^{\sqrt{z-x^2}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dy \, dx \, dz + \int_{2}^{8} \int_{-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z)}}^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z)}} \int_{-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3x^2)}}^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3x^2)}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dy \, dx \, dz
                </me>.
                Finally, we integrate with respect to <m>x</m> first.
                The symmetry in the surface indicates that these integrals will be similar to ones with <m>y</m> first.
                So the mass of the solid is also given by
                <me>
                  \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{y^2}^{2} \int_{-\sqrt{z-y^2}}^{\sqrt{z-y^2}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dx \, dz \, dy + \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{2}^{8-3y^2} \int_{-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3y^2)}}^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3y^2)}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dx \, dz \, dy
                </me>
                and
                <me>
                  \int_{0}^{2} \int_{-\sqrt{z}}^{\sqrt{z}} \int_{-\sqrt{z-y^2}}^{\sqrt{z-y^2}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dx \, dy \, dz + \int_{2}^{8} \int_{-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z)}}^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z)}} \int_{-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3y^2)}}^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(8-z-3y^2)}} \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1} \, dx \, dy \, dz
