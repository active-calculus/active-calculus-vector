    This text is an extension of the single variable <em>Active Calculus</em> by Matt Boelkins. The initial drafts of this multivariable edition were written by Steve Schlicker; editing and revisions were made by David Austin and Matt Boelkins. David Austin is responsible for the beautiful full-color graphics in Chapters 9 through 11. Many people at GVSU have shared their ideas and resources, which undoubtedly had a significant influence on the product. We thank them for all of their support. Most importantly, we would like to thank the students who have used this text and offered helpful advice and suggestions.

    Early html versions of this text were made possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of <pretext />. Dr. Schlicker's ability to take advantage of Rob's work is largely due to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics, which funded him for a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, in April 2016. David Farmer also deserves credit for the original conversion of the text from <latex /> to <pretext />. The <pretext /> community continues to provide enormous support and capabilities to all of the authors as we continually strive to provide an excellent text while updating the utility of this resource.
