      In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>. <idx><h>locally linear</h></idx> In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function around a point, the graph  will look like the tangent line to the function at that point. In <xref ref="LLline" /> you can look at the graph of a curve and zoom in around a point on that curve to see that eventually the graph of the function will look linear. You can use the sliders at the top of change how zoomed in the plot is displayed or change the location on the curve that you are examining. You should visually verify at a several points that this function is differentiable because at any point shown, the graph is locally linear.

      Linear functions (of the form <m>f(x)=ax+b</m>) play important roles in single variable calculus and are useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will study curves in space and we will see that connection between local linearity and differentiability exists for curves in three (or more!) dimensions. Additionally, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space, as these correspond to graphs of linear expressions in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>. (Recall that a function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less than or equal to 1. For example, <m>x-1</m> defines a single variable linear expression and <m>x+y+2</m> a two variable linear expression. But <m>xy</m> is not linear since it has degree two, the sum of the degrees of its factors.) We will study planes and lines in <m>\R^3</m> as flat graphs before we look at curves and surfaces in general. In your study of 1-variable functions, you probably worked with ideas like slope, direction, and measuring change using lines several times before you generalized those ideas for a curve in general. Similarly, we will want to have a good idea about how we talk about direction and measuring change along flat objects in <m>\R^3</m> (lines and planes) before we start generalizing to curved objects.

      <introduction>
       <p>
          We will start our work on lines by considering some familiar ideas in <m>\R^2</m> but from a new perspective. You are probably familiar with equations of lines in the <m>xy</m>-plane in the form <m>y = mx+b</m>, where <m>m</m> is the slope of the line and <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines that is useful in the <m>xy</m>-plane and higher dimensions. To begin, consider the line through the point <m>(2,-1)</m> with slope <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> as shown in <xref ref="PA-Lineplot1">Figure</xref>.

            Suppose we increase <m>x</m> by 1 from the point <m>(2,-1)</m>. How does the <m>y</m>-value change? What is the point on the line with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>3</m>?

        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            As we increase <m>x</m> by 1, the <m>y</m>-value increases by <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>. The point on the line with the <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>3</m> is <m>(3, -\frac{1}{3})</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If a line has a slope of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>, this means that an increase of 3 in the <m>x</m>-direction results in increase of 2 in the <m>y</m>-direction. If we scale this to a one-unit rate of change, an increase of 1 unit in the <m>x</m>-direction results in an increase of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction. From the point <m>(2, -1)</m> to the point with an <m>x</m>-value of 3, this requires a 1 unit increase in the rate of change in the <m>x</m>-direction, which results in an increase of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction. Therefore, the point on the line with an <m>x</m>-coordinate of <m>3</m> is <m>(3, -1 + \frac{2}{3}) = (3, -\frac{1}{3})</m>.

        <answer>
          <p>
            As we decrease <m>x</m> by 3.25 from <m>(2, -1)</m>, the <m>y</m>-value decreases by <m>\frac{13}{6}</m>. The point on the line with the <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>-1.25</m> is <m>(-1.25, -\frac{19}{6})</m>.

            Remember that the horizontal component of a vector describes the <q>run</q> and the vertical component measures the <q>rise</q> of the vector. So the slope of the line is related to <em>any</em> vector whose <m>y</m>-component divided by the <m>x</m>-component is the slope of the line. For the line in this activity, we might use the vector <m>\langle 3,2 \rangle</m> to describe the direction of the line. We will look at the following vector valued function of one variable:
            <me>
              \vr(t) = \langle 2,-1 \rangle + \langle 3,2 \rangle t,
            </me>
            For each of the values of <m>t</m> below, find <m>\vr(t)</m> and write your result as a single vector (of the form <m>\langle a,b\rangle</m>)
            <ol>

            The terminal point of the vector <m>\langle 2, -1 \rangle</m> is the point <m>(2, -1)</m>.

      The way most people draw a line is more connected to the ideas in <xref ref="PA_9_5" /> than slope or algebraic forms. Take a minute and draw a plot of the line described by <m>x+y-1=0</m>. You should not continue reading until you have made a plot (by hand) of <m>x+y-1=0</m> that you would be proud to share with classmates.

      You may have done some algebra or other calculation to get to slope-intercept form or another familiar algebraic structure, but when you went to draw the line you almost certainly did the following steps 
      <ol>
        <li>found a point to start your plot (maybe the y-intercept)</li>
        <li>found a second point on your plot (perhaps using the slope to find the second point)</li>
        <li>drew a line segment from the first point to the second, then extended the line past the second point to the end of you plot</li>
        <li>went back to the first point and extended the line in the direction opposite of the second point</li>
      </ol>
      In other words, you made a starting point, extended indefinitely far in a particular direction, then added the opposite direction. This is the essence of the general description for a line we will give below. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set of points satisfying the equation
      <me>
        y = mx + b,
      </me>
      for some constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. The value of <m>m</m> (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept and anchors the line to a location on the <m>y</m>-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to the vector <m>\langle 1, m \rangle</m>, which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in <xref ref="Lineplot3">Figure</xref>. Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point <m>P</m> and a direction <m>\vv</m>, as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space (<m>\R^n</m>) to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a line works in <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>n</m>.

As we saw in <xref ref="PA_9_5">Preview Activity</xref>, to find an equation for a line through point <m>P</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, any vector parallel to <m>\vv</m> will have the form <m>t \vv</m> for some scalar <m>t</m>. So, any vector emanating from the point <m>P</m> in a direction parallel to the vector <m>\vv</m> will be of the form
      <men xml:id="eq_9_5_lines_1">
        \overrightarrow{OP} + \vv t
      </men>
      for some scalar <m>t</m> (where <m>O</m> is the origin).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the figure below, you can use the slider to change the value of <m>t</m> for this example line. You should pay attention to how <m> \overrightarrow{OP} + \vv t</m> changes as you vary <m>t</m>.

            Lines in the <m>xy</m>-plane are commonly described using the slope-intercept equation <m>y=mx + b</m>. The vector form of the line, as described above, is an alternative way to represent lines that has the two advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines, whose slope <m>m</m> is not defined, using a vertical direction vector. For example, the vertical line described by <m>x=2</m> could be described in vector form with a direction vector like <m>\vv=\langle 0, 1\rangle</m>, giving <m>\vr(t)= \langle 2,0\rangle +t \langle 0,1\rangle</m>. The second advantage of the vector form of a line is that this description of lines works in <em>any</em> dimension whereas the concept of slope of a line does not generalize to three or more dimensions.

            Let's give a vector form of the line that is the <m>y</m>-axis in <m>\R^3</m>. We need to pick a point on our line and a direction vector for our line. A convenient point would be the origin and we can use <m>\vj=\langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m> as our direction vector. This give a vector form of <m>\vr_1(t)=\langle 0,0,0 \rangle + t\langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m> which can be combined to a single vector form of <m>\vr_1(t)=\langle 0,t,0 \rangle</m>. This form should not be suprising since the <m>y</m>-axis consists of points with <m>x</m>- and <m>z</m>-coordinates of zero while the <m>y</m>-coordinate can be any real number. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We had many other choices we could have made for the initial point and the direction vector used to create the vector form of the <m>y</m>-axis. We could have selected the point <m>(0,\pi,0)</m> and the direction vector given by <m>\langle 0,-\frac{11}{7},0 \rangle</m>. While these are likely not choices you would have made, this point and direction vector still describe the necessary information to give the vector form of the <m>y</m>-axis. The associated vector form of the <m>y</m>-axis would be <m>\vr_2(t)=\langle 0,\pi,0\rangle + t \langle 0,-\frac{11}{7},0 \rangle=\langle 0,\pi-\frac{11}{7}t,0 \rangle </m>. It is unlikely that anyone else has ever described the <m>y</m>-axis with this equation but the terminal points of the output vectors for <m>\vr_2(t)</m> do trace out the entire <m>y</m>-axis.

            You can pretty easily verify visually (using <xref ref="Lineplot3d" />) that <m>L_1</m>, the line in <m>\R^3</m> that goes through <m>(1,2,1)</m> and moves in the direction <m>\langle 1,1,-\frac{1}{2} \rangle </m> does not intersect the <m>y</m>-axis. In two dimensions, two lines were parallel if they did not intersect but like slope this idea does translate to higher dimensions because <m>L_1</m> is not parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis. In general, two lines in <m>\R^n</m> are <term>parallel</term> if they can be described with direction vectors that are parallel. Remember that two vectors are parallel if they are non-zero scalar multiples of each other. This should make sense from the perspective that parallel lines should move in the same direction, but the same direction can be described by <em>ANY</em> parallel vector.

    <title>The Parametric Equations of a Line</title>
    <p>
      The vector form of a line, <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_9_5_line_vect"/>, describes a line as the set of terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If <m>vr_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle</m> and <m>\vv = \langle a, b, c \rangle</m>, then we can view this vector form in terms of components and get the following:
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle + t \langle a, b, c \rangle = \langle x_0+at, y_0+bt, z_0+ct \rangle
      </me>
      Splitting this vector form into each component equation gives
      <me>
        x(t) = x_0 + at \quad \quad y(t) = y_0 + bt \quad \quad z(t) = z_0 + ct
      </me>
      These equations describe the coordinates of the points on the line separately where each is coordinate is a function of <m>t</m>. The variable <m>t</m> represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a <em>parameter</em>. In particular, we use the following language.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should note here that there are <em>many</em> different parametric equations for the same
      line. For example, choosing another point <m>P</m> on the line or another direction vector <m>\vv</m> produces another set of parametric equations. In many physical applications, it is useful to think of <m>t</m> as a time parameter and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a particular way to walk along the line; there are, of course, many possible ways to walk along the same line. In mathematical terms, we say that the parameterization of a line is not unique.

            Set each parametric equation equal to the corresponding component of the given point: <m>1 = 1 - 3t, 2 = 2 - t, 1 = -1 - t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 0, t = 0,</m> and <m>t = -1</m>. Therefore, the point <m>(1, 2, 1)</m> does not lie on <m>\mathcal{L}</m>.

            The direction of <m>\mathcalc{K}</m> is <m>\langle 4, -3, 2 \rangle</m>.

            To find the direction vector of <m>\mathcal{K}</m>, we look at the coefficients of the <m>s</m> terms: <m>\langle 4, -3, 2 \rangle</m>.

            Do the lines <m>\mathcal{L}</m> and <m>\mathcal{K}</m> intersect?  If so, provide the point of intersection and the <m>t</m> and <m>s</m> values, respectively, that result in the point.  If not, explain why. To find a point of intersection, you can set the coordinate equations of each line equal to each other try to solve for <m>t</m> and <m>s</m>.

             Remember that the two lines need to go through the same <m>(x,y,z)</m> point but do not need to have the same parameter value at that point (which is why we used <em>different</em> variable names for the parameters <m>t</m> and <m>s</m>).

            <m>\mathcal{L}</m> and <m>\mathcalc{K}</m> intersect at <m>(7, 4, 1)</m>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The direction vectors for lines <m>\mathcal{L}</m> and <m>\mathcal{K}</m> are not scalar multiples. Therefore the lines will intersect. We can set the corresponding parametric equations equal to each other than then use 2 of the equations to solve a system.

          <p>
            <m>1 - 3t = 11 + 4s, 2 - t = 1- 3s</m>. Solve this system to get <m>s = -1, t = -2</m>. Plug either of these values into the parametric equations for the corresponding line to get the point <m>(7, 4, 1)</m>.

      Before we move on to our discussion of planes in the next section, we will talk about some terminology that may helpful in describing features and measurements later. A line is a one-dimensional, flat graph in three (or <m>n</m>) dimensions. We say the line is a one-dimensional graph because there is only one direction to go and stay on the graph (forward/backward). We say that a line is flat because the direction you are allowed to go doesn't change as you move along the graph. Note that flat does <em>not</em> mean horizontal. A circle would be another example of a one-dimensional graph that can be drawn in two or more dimensional space (because there is only one direction to move along the circle) but a circle is not flat since the direction you go to stay on the figure changes as you move along the graph. As we will see in the next section, a plane in three dimensional space is an example of a flat, two-dimensional graph. If you were an ant on a plane, you would have two dimensions you can move in while staying on the graph (forward/backward or left/right), but the direction(s) that the graph extends does not change when you move locations on the plane.

          While lines in <m>\R^3</m> do not have a slope, like lines in <m>\R^2</m> they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector.  Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.

          Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line.  In particular, the terminal points of the vector <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> define a linear function <m>\vr</m> in space through the terminal point of the vector <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vv</m>, tracing out a line in space.
