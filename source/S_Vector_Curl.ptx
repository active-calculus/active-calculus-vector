<introduction>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_Vector_Div"/>, we examined how the strength of a
    vector field in two (or more) dimensions changed in different
    regions. In particular, we developed the <xref ref="defn_Div" text="custom">divergence</xref> of a vector field as a local (or
    density) measurement for how the strength of the vector field
    changes. The key ideas when interpreting divergence are:
    <ul>
      <li>A positive divergence means that the vector field is growing in strength.</li>
      <li>A negative divergence means that the vector field is decreasing in strength.</li>
      <li>A zero divergence means that the vector field is not changing in strength.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In many physical settings, it is also useful to measure the rotational strength of a vector field at a local scale. For instance, the vector field on the left of <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_intro_vfs">Figure</xref> shows a vector field which flows in a counterclockwise fashion around the origin. The vector field on the right of <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_intro_vfs">Figure</xref> shows a vector field which does not have a rotational aspect to its flow.

    These global ideas of rotation are nice, but are not always visually apparent or may only appear in some regions. For instance, the vector field on the left of <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_intro_vfs2"/> seems to have rotation around at least a couple of different points. In each quadrant, the vector field on the right of <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_intro_vfs2"/> has different rotational patterns.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of
        spinner we imagine is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_Spinner"/>. It consists of a central axis
        with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and
        the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner's paddle. In this activity, we will be trying to assess how the the spinner will rotate around the black axel (as an axis of rotation).

        To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field <m>\vF</m> in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_PA_0x"/>. As you think about these questions, draw an <q>X</q> at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.

As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade.

<subsection xml:id="SS_Vector_Curl_Development">
  <title>Measuring the Circulation Density of Vector Field in <m>\R^2</m></title>
  <p>
    In this subsection, we will develop the measurement of the circulation density for a two-dimensional vector field. We will use this measurement to generalize to a notion of rotational strength in higher dimensional cases in the next subsection.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will start by measuring the circulation of a vector field on a path around the point <m>(a,b)</m> and use this measurement to define circulation density. Specifically, we will measure the circulation of a vector field as we move around a square centered at <m>(a,b)</m>. Using this measurement, we will calculate the circulation density by dividing our measurement by the area enclosed. This will allow us to compare our measurement across regions of different sizes. By taking the limit of this circulation density as the square's side length goes to zero, we
    will have the circulation density at the point <m>(a,b)</m>. Just as in our discussion of <xref ref="SS_Vector_Div_Development"/>, we will look at a two dimensional setting first, then examine how our argument can be generalized to higher dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's start by measuring the circulation around a square with side length <m>2h</m> centered at a point <m>(a,b)</m>. Namely, we will look at the line integral of our vector field as we move along the square curve shown in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_DevSquare"/>.

    We can parametrize the top edge of the square using the parametrization
    <me> \vr_{\text{top}}(t) = \langle a-t,b+h\rangle
    </me>
    for <m>-h\leq t\leq h</m>. Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized (over the same range of values for <m>t</m>) as follows:
    <md>
      <mrow>\vr_{\text{bottom}}(t) \amp= \langle a+t,b-h\rangle</mrow>
      <mrow>\vr_{\text{right}}(t) \amp= \langle a+h,b+t\rangle</mrow>
      <mrow>\vr_{\text{left}}(t) \amp= \langle a-h,b-t\rangle</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to measure the circulation around the square, we want to know how much of the vector field <m>\vF = \langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> is parallel to the direction of travel. Thus, along each of the sides of the box, we only need to look at one of the components of the vector field. The only contribution to the circulation on the top and bottom comes from the horizontal component <m>F_1</m>. Similarly, the vertical component, <m>F_2</m>, is all that contributes to the circulation on the right and left sides. This means that we can simplify our line integrals considerably once we apply <xref ref="thm_LineIntParam"/>. For instance, the circulation on the top can be written as
    <me>
      \int_{\text{top}} \vF \cdot d\vr=\int_{-h}^h \langle F_1,F_2\rangle \cdot \langle -1,0\rangle \, dt = \int_{-h}^h -F_1( a-t,b+h) \, dt
    </me>
    Similarly, we can simplify the appropriate line integrals on the other sides (ordered below as top, left, bottom, right) to get the total circulation around the square to be
    <md>
      <mrow>
      \text{Total Circulation} =\amp \int_{\text{Square}} \vF \cdot d\vr 
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
      =\amp \int_{-h}^h -F_1(a-t,b+h) \, dt +  \int_{-h}^h -F_2(a-h,b-t) \, dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
     \amp + \int_{-h}^h F_1(a+t,b-h) \, dt + \int_{-h}^h
     F_2(a+h,b+t) \, dt
      </mrow>
    </md>
    Note that on the top and the left sides, we must switch the sign because the direction of travel on these sides is in the negative coordinate direction. It is important to note that by convention, we talk about <q>positive</q> rotation being counterclockwise and <q>negative</q> rotation being clockwise when looking at these planar graphs. This will be discussed more fully in <xref ref="SS_Vector_Curl_Development3D"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with our development of divergence, we apply the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to the four integrals above to simplify future calculations. Specifically, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals applied to the first integral tells us that there is a value, <m>t_{\text{top}}^*</m>, in the interval <m>(a-h,a+h)</m> such that
    <me>
      \int_{-h}^h -F_1( a-t,b+h) \, dt=  -2h \left(F_1(t_{\text{top}}^*,b+h)\right)
    </me>
    Applying the same arguments to the other three integrals in our Total Circulation calculation gives
    <md>
      <mrow>
      \text{Total Circulation} =\amp \int_{\text{Square}} \vF \cdot d\vr
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        =\amp \int_{-h}^h -F_1(a-t,b+h) \, dt +  \int_{-h}^h -F_2(a-h,b-t) \, dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp + \int_{-h}^h F_1(a+t,b-h) \, dt + \int_{-h}^h F_2(a+h,b+t) \, dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        =\amp -2h F_1(t_{\text{top}}^*,b+h) -2h F_2(a-h,t_{\text{left}}^*) 
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp + 2h F_1(t_{\text{bottom}}^*,b-h)+2h F_2(a+h,t_{\text{right}}^*)
      </mrow>
    </md>
    Here we have <m>t_{\text{top}}^*,t_{\text{bottom}}^* \in (a-h,a+h)</m> and <m>t_{\text{left}}^*,t_{\text{right}}^* \in (b-h,b+h)</m>. We can regroup these terms to get the following expression for the total circulation around our square:
    <md>
      <mrow>2h\left(F_2(a+h,b_{\text{right}}^*)-F_2(a-h,b_{\text{left}}^*)\right) </mrow>
      <mrow> \quad -2h\left(F_1(a_{\text{top}}^*,b+h)-F_1(a_{\text{bottom}}^*,b-h)\right)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    A larger square is likely to have a larger total circulation since there is more distance to accumulate how much the vector field is moving in the same direction as our path. This is why the side length <m>2h</m> of the square appears as a factor in the formula for our total circulation. In order to compare our rotational or circulation ideas over different sizes of squares, we will now look at the <term>circulation density</term> (strength of rotation per unit area), which can be computed directly from our total circulation measurement. We can
    take the limit of the circulation density as we shrink the square to the central point <m>(a,b)</m> and get a measurement rotational strength of our vector field at a point.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will compute our circulation density as
    <me>
      \text{Circulation Density}=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\text{Total Circulation}}{\text{Area of Square}}
    </me>.
    Since the area of the square is <m>(2h)^2 = 4h^2</m>, this gives us that the circulation density is
    <me>
      \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{F_2(a+h,t_{\text{right}}^*)-F_2(a-h,t_{\text{left}}^*)}{2h} -
      \frac{F_1(t_{\text{top}}^*,b+h)-F_1(t_{\text{bottom}}^*,b-h)}{2h}

    Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html#VjW" visual="activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html#VjW">Section 1.5.2</url> and notice that as <m>h\to 0</m>, <m>t_{\text{top}}^*,t_{\text{bottom}}^*</m> must go to <m>a</m> and <m>t_{\text{left}}^*,t_{\text{right}}^*</m> must go to <m>b</m>. Therefore, our circulation density measurement at a point is
    <me> 
      \text{Circulation Density at the point }(a,b)= \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} (a,b)-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} (a,b)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    You may have noticed that this argument had a similar flow to the development of divergence in <xref ref="S_Vector_Div">Section</xref>. However, the result here is different because the property of the vector field we were trying to measure was different. Because divergence was developed to measure the change in the <em>strength</em> of the vector field (without regard to the direction), divergence is computed using the partial derivatives of the horizontal component of the vector field with respect to the horizontal variable and the vertical component of the vector field with respect to the vertical variable. The circulation density we just developed measures how
    the <em>direction</em> of the vector field is changing, and thus uses partial derivatives of the components with respect to the transverse variable. In other words, the rotational aspects of the vector field depend on how the horizontal component of the vector field changes when we move vertically (and vice versa).
  </p>
  <p>
    We could have used a shape other than a square in the development of the circulation density, but a square allows for calculations that are easier to understand as the area of the shape decreases. <!--Our use of rectangular coordinates made it easiest to use rectangular figures but more general arguments exist.-->

      Remember that the circulation density of a vector field <m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> at a point <m>(a,b)</m> is calculated as

    The previous subsection showed how we can measure the circulation density, or strength of rotation, at a point for a two-dimensional vector field. In this subsection, we will look at how this two-dimensional measurement can be used to define circulation density for three dimensional vector fields.

    We first need to consider how we want to represent and measure rotation in three dimensions. When we developed the
    circulation density on the <m>xy</m>-plane, we measured the rotational strength at a point <m>(a,b)</m> with an axis of rotation coming out of the <m>xy</m>-plane. This corresponds to the axis of rotation being given by the blue vector in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_RotIn3D"/>. Remember that <q>positive</q> rotation corresponds to counterclockwise rotation in the <m>xy</m>-plane. We can generalize this idea to think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where
    <ul>
      <li>the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and </li>
      <li>the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.</li>
    </ul>
    By convention, we consider positive <q>rotation</q> to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the terminal point of the vector to its initial point. <!--Alternatively, if we look along the vector from the base point to the final point, positive rotation corresponds to clockwise rotation.--> In <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_3DRotations"/>, you can see that each vector corresponds to the rotation displayed and is consistent with the conventions described above.

    If you look carefully at <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_3DRotations"/>, you can see that the vector shown in blue will be parallel to <m>\vk</m> and will represent rotations on planes of the form <m>z=c</m>. Similarly, the vector shown in yellow will be parallel to <m>\vi</m> and will represent rotations on planes of the form <m>x=a</m>. When looking down the blue and yellow vectors (from the terminal to the initial point), you can see the positive coordinate axes as pointing to the right and up<fn>When placing the <m>x</m>-axis horizontally for the blue vector and placing the <m>y</m>-axis horizontally for the yellow vector</fn> (as we would expect on a two-dimensional plot). In contrast, when you look down the magenta vector (from the terminal to the initial point), the positive coordinate axes (the <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> axes) point to the left and up.<fn>When placing the <m>x</m>-axis horizontally.</fn> In fact, when we look down the magenta vector the <m>xz</m>-plane is flipped. A positive rotation on a plane of the form <m>y=b</m> will correspond to a rotation vector that is in the direction of <m>-\vj</m>. This is a consequence of the right-handed coordinate system and our right-handed idea of rotation, as reflected in the relationships amongst the vectors <m>\vi,\vj\,vk</m> recalled below:
    <me>
      \vi \times \vj = \vk \quad \quad  \vi \times \vk = -\vj \quad \quad  \vj \times \vk = \vi 
    </me>
    <!--The above ideas correspond to the corresponding coordinate vector relationships of a right handed coordinate system.-->
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
    If we look at the same slice of the vector field from the other side in three dimensions, the notion of rotation (clockwise versus counterclockwise) switches exactly with the orientation of the direction. Consider the following to plots of a vector field on the <m>xy</m>-plane when viewed from the positive and negative <m>z</m>-axis.

    By using a vector to represent the rotation of some element, we have enabled all of the tools that vectors allow, especially the ideas of projection and linear combinations. Remember that the projection of a vector <m>\vv</m> onto a vector <m>\vu</m> will give the vector component of <m>\vv</m> that is parallel to <m>\vu</m>. In other words, the projection of <m>\vv</m> onto <m>\vu</m> is how much of <m>\vv</m> is parallel to <m>\vu</m>. The projection formula will allow us to take a vector representation of rotation and determine how much rotation happens around a given axis of rotation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that we have used a set of coordinate vectors (namely <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>) to write other vectors as a linear combination of our base vectors. In other words, a vector <m>\langle a,b,c\rangle</m> in <m>\R^3</m> can be written in the form <m>a\vi+b\vj+c\vk</m>.

    The linear combination of vectors will allow us to build the total rotation vector by measuring the rotational strength in the direction of three coordinate direction vectors. Just as in <xref ref="ijk_vector_sum" />, we will build our total rotation vector as a sum of <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>, but we will think of the initial point of the black vector as being at our point of interest <m>(u,v,w)</m>A rotation vector in the direction of <m>\vk</m> at a point <m>(u,v,w)</m> will measure the circulation density at our point restricted to the trace plane <m>z=w</m>. Similarly the rotation vectors in the directions <m>\vi</m> and <m>\vj</m> will measure the circulation density on the trace planes <m>x=u</m> and <m>y=v</m>, respectively.

<subsection >
  <title>Circulation Density in Three Dimensions</title>
  <p>
    The previous subsection discussed how we can view the amount of rotation of a three-dimensional vector field in a plane parallel to the <m>xy</m>-, <m>xz</m>-, or <m>yz</m>-plane and recalled that vectors in <m>\R^3</m> can be written as a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>. We use our definition of curl for a two-dimensional vector field to measure the amount of rotation in the appropriate planes, which leads to the following definition.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="Curl_defn">
    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2,F_3\rangle</m> be a three-dimensional vector field. The <term>curl</term> of <m>\vF</m> is given by
      <me>
        \curl(\vF)= \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial z}\right)\vi- \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial z}\right)\vj + \left(\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}\right)\vk
      </me>.
     </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <aside>
    <title>Alternate Notation for Curl</title>
    <p>
      As with divergence, there is an alternate notation for curl that uses the del operator <m>\nabla = \langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \rangle</m>. Specifically, for a three-dimensional vector field <m>\vF</m>, <m>\curl(\vF) = \nabla\times \vF</m>.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    The curl is exactly the rotational description described at the end of <xref ref="SS_Vector_Curl_Development3D"/>. When evaluated at a point <m>(u,v,w)</m>, the first component of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the plane <m>x=u</m>. Similarly, the second and third components of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the planes <m>y=v</m> and <m>z=w</m>, respectively.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      In this example, we will look at <m>\vF=\langle 0,x,0\rangle </m>. Applying <xref ref="Curl_defn" />,
      <me>
        \curl(\vF)= \left\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(0) -\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(x), - \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(0)-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(0) \right) , \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x)-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(0) \right\rangle
      </me>
      Thus, <m>\curl(\vF)=\langle 0,0,1\rangle</m>. This means that <m>\vF</m> will have a rotational aspect only with an axis parallel to the <m>z</m>-axis. This should not be suprising since the plot of <m>\vF</m> will be the same as <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_PA_0x" /> copied on each plane <m>z=c</m>. As you saw in <xref ref="PA_Vector_Curl" />, this vector field will have constant rotational strength at every point with axis of rotation in the <m>\vk</m> direction.
    </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    We next consider an example where the trace of the vector field in planes parallel to coordinate planes is not as easy to visualize as in the previous example.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      In this example, we will look at <m>\vG=\langle x,y,z\rangle </m>. If we apply <xref ref="Curl_defn" />, we obtain
      <me>
        \curl(\vG)= \left\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(z) -\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(y), - \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(z)-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(x) \right) , \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (y)-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x) \right\rangle
      </me>
      Therefore, we have <m>\curl(\vG)=\langle 0,0,0\rangle</m>. Thus, <m>\vG</m> will have no rotational strength anywhere. In <xref ref="fig_xyz_plot" /> we  have a plot of <m>\vG</m>, which illustrates that dropping a spinner at any point in space will not have the spinner rotate. No matter what orientation the spinner will have, there will be equal force on each side of the spinner, and thus the spinner will not rotate.

      Therefore, <m>\curl(\vH)=\langle 0,2x,-1\rangle</m>. This tells us that the vector field <m>\vH</m> will have a non-zero curl for every point. However, it will be quite difficult to <q>see</q> the curl at a particular point. The next activity will take you through the process of trying to visualize and understand the output of curl in three dimensions.

          This figure shows that the forces on the blades of a spinner at the red point would be almost balanced. An important difference is going to be that arrow on the right side do not have quite as large of a vertical component as the vectors on the left. This will cause a spinner to rotate counterclockwise, so the rotational strength at this point will be negative. A representative form would be <m> c \langle 0,0,1 \rangle</m> where <m>c</m> represents the rotational strength at the point. So we will use <m>  \langle 0,0,-c \rangle</m> with <m>c\gt0</m>.

<subsection xml:id="SS_Vector_Curl_Interpretation">
  <title>Interpretation and Usage of Curl</title>
  <p>
    It is worth making explicit a fact that we have used implicitly throughout this section: the curl of a vector field is itself a vector field! That is, evaluating <m>\curl(\vF)</m> at a point gives a vector. As we saw earlier in this section, the vector output of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> represents the rotational strength of the vector field <m>\vF</m> as a linear combination of rotational strengths (or circulation densities) from two-dimensional planar descriptions. From our description of vectors as a representation of rotations, We can think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where
    <ul>
      <li>the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and</li>
      <li>the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.</li>
    </ul>
    By convention, we consider positive <q>rotation</q> to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the end of the vector to the base.
  </p>
  <p>
    With these conventions, the output vector of the curl evaluated at a point <m>P</m>, written as <m>\curl(\vF)(P)</m>, will have the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li>The direction of <m>\curl(\vF)(P)</m> will be the axis of rotation that has the strongest positive rotational strength.</li>
      <li>The magnitude of <m>\curl(\vF)(P)</m> will be the circulation density of the vector field in the plane through <m>P</m> with normal vector <m>\curl(\vF)(P)</m>. </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The following theorem allows us to use <m>\curl(\vF)</m> to measure the rotational strength of <m>\vF</m> around an arbitrary axis. This will be particularly useful to us in later sections.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Vector_Curl_rot_strength">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The rotational strength of a vector field <m>\vF</m> around an axis given by a unit vector <m>\vv</m> at a point <m>P=(a,b,c)</m> can be computed by <m> \left(\curl(\vF)(a,b,c)\right)\cdot \vv</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>This follows from the formula for the component of
      <m>\curl(\vF)(a,b,c)</m> along <m>\vv</m> and the fact that
      <m>\vv</m> was selected to be a unit vector.</p>

          All points would have positve components of curl since there will be counterclockwise rotation on every plane (not containing the z-axis).

  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The circulation of a vector field on a closed path measures how strong the vector field moves in the direction of travel for the path. The circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field <m>\vF=\langle{F_1,F_2}\rangle</m> is given by 
          <me>
            \text{Circulation Density at the point }(a,b)= \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} (a,b)-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} (a,b) 
          </me>.
          The circulation density can be visualized in terms of how fast a very small spinner anchored to <m>(a,b)</m> will rotate as a result of the force of <m>\vF</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          By considering the circulation density of a three-dimensional vector field <m>\vF = \langle F_1,F_2,F_2\rangle</m> in planes parallel to the coordinate planes, we can calculate the curl of <m>\vF</m> as
          <me>
            \curl(\vF)= \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial
            y}-\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial z}\right)\vi-
            \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial
            F_1}{\partial z}\right)\vj + \left(\frac{\partial
            F_2}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}\right)\vk
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          For a three-dimensional vector field <m>\vF</m>, the vector <m>\curl(\vF)(a,b,c)</m> points along the axis of rotation with the greatest rotational strength at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m>. The magnitude of <m>\curl(\vF)(a,b,c)</m> measures the strength of the rotation in this maximal direction. The strength of rotation around an axis determined by a unit vector <m>\vv</m> is found by calculating <m>\left(\curl(\vF)(a,b,c)\right)\cdot \vv</m>

  <task xml:id="task_PA_Vector_Curl_-yx">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field <m>\vF</m> in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Curl_PA_-yx"/>. As you think about these questions, draw an <q>X</q> at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.

    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Draw a X at the origin to act as your spinner. Now, draw a vector on the top right blade of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade. Next, draw a vector on each of the other blades of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at the origin would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Now we would like to look at the rotational strength of <m>\vF</m> at the point <m>(1,1)</m>. As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade. It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.

          Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at <m>(1,1)</m> would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all. You should pay attention to which blades will have a stronger force (in comparison to the blade on the other side).

  <title>Notes to Instructors and Dependencies</title>
<p>
  This section relies heavily on understanding vector fields from <xref ref="S_Vector_VectorFields" />. If the calculation of the curl is your primary purpose for using this section, then you can skip many of the details of <xref ref="SS_Vector_Curl_Development" /> and <xref ref="SS_Vector_Curl_Development3D" />. The details have been made as bite-sized as possible, but the particulars of curl typically aren't easily understood without some of the calculations of circulation density. Additionally, the visualization of vector fields in 3D makes geometric interpretations harder to demonstrate.
