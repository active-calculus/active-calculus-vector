        How can a definite integral be used to measure the length of a curve in 2- or 3-space?

<introduction>
<p>
  In the previous sections we have introduced the notation and graphs for vector valued functions, as well as how the calculus operations of limits, derivatives, and integrals will apply to these functions. In this section we will start our work on utilizing these calculus elements alongside our vector tools (like magnitude, direction, or projections) to measure important properties and find ways to efficiently calculate how these properties change along our curve. The first property we will investigate comes up very naturally when looking at curves in space: <q>What is the length of a given curve in space?</q> Remember that <xref ref="Distance-formula" >the distance between two points in space</xref> is given by 
  <me>
    \vert{PQ}\vert = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}
  </me>
  The length of a curve is different than the displacement (change in position) as we will see in the Preview Activity.
</p>
<exploration xml:id="PA-arclength" >
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_9_6" /> and <xref ref="PA_9_7" /> we saw how the location tracking system's (LTS)output is related to a vector valued function that corresponds to how our car is being driven. In order to attract investors and drive shareholder value in <em>Steer Clear</em>, you decide to use the location tracking system's output to build a customized navigation and telemetry tool for a self driving car. The first element you will need to build is a way to use the LTS output to calculate how far the car has driven in a given time. 
    </p>
  </introduction> 
  <task xml:id="PA-arclength1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In your testing center, you drive your car up a parking ramp and note that the LTS recorded the car had coordinates of <m>\langle 10,-5,0\rangle</m> at <m>t=0</m> and <m>\langle -8,10,12\rangle</m> when <m>t=30</m>. What is the distance between initial (<m>t=0</m>) and final (<m>t=30</m>)positions of the car?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task> 
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Do you think the distance the car actually traveled is greater than, less than, or the same as your answer to <xref ref="PA-arclength1" />? Write a couple of sentences to explain your reasoning.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task xml:id="PA-arclength3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In order to get more information for your telemetry system, you decide to pull the location data from your drive up the parking ramp every 10 seconds. The LTS gives the following data
        <ul>
          <li><m>\langle 10,-5,0\rangle</m> at <m>t=0</m></li>
          <li><m>\langle 6,0,6 \rangle</m> when <m>t=10</m></li>
          <li><m>\langle -10,2,10\rangle</m> when <m>t=20</m></li>
          <li><m>\langle -8,10,12\rangle</m> when <m>t=30</m></li>
        </ul>
        Calculate the distance between successive times and estimate how far your car went in on the drive up the parking ramp. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Do you think your estimate from <xref ref="PA-arclength3" /> is greater than, less than, or equal to the actual distance traveled? Write a couple of sentences to explain your reasoning. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        You look into the documentation on your location tracking system and see that you can specify how often to output the location data. You decide that getting the location every half a second seems like a good idea. How many data points will that correspond to for your drive up the parking ramp? Write a few sentences to describe what steps you would take with this new location data to calculate a better estimate on the distance traveled by your car.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
</exploration>
<p>
  The last task is an example of a vital skill mathematics, scientific, and engineering fields called algorithmic thinking. Algorithmic thinking involves breaking larger problems into different tasks where a precise set of rules or operations can be stated for each task. We have referred to our classic calculus approach in a few scenarios (and will again this section) and we will take a moment here to mention how the classic calculus approach has the structure of this algorithmic thinking. Specifically, the tasks for our classic calculus approach can be summarized as as 1) approximate, 2) quantify how approximation changes with scale or refinement, 3) apply limit to describe how approximation converges to the measurement of interest. The details of how each of these tasks is done will change depending on the measurement, which is why so much time will be spent talking about the details of tasks 1 and 2 when introducing new concepts.

  <p>
    As suggested by our work in the Preview Activity and the classic calculus approach, we will approximate the length of the curve <m>C</m> by computing the length of a collection of line segments between points on <m>C</m>. In particular, we will call these intermediate points <m>\vr_0,\vr_1,...\vr_n</m>. Remember that we are specifying location using vectors to be graphed in standard position. Using vectors to specify position means that the corresponding line segments between successive <m>vr_i</m> positions can be represented by the vector difference <m>\Delta\vr_i = \vr_{i}-\vr_{i-1}</m>.

  </figure>
  <p>
    Notice that the description above does not involve a parameterization of <m>C</m> or a description for how you are traveling along <m>C</m>. In general, it is easiest to generate the positions <m>\vr_i</m> by evaluating a parameterization at a different <m>t</m>-values. In particular, we will use <m>\vr(t)=\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)</m>, a parameterization of <m>C</m> to specify the points between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>. Specifically, if <m>\vr(t)</m> is a parameterization of <m>C</m> with <m>P=\vr(a)</m> and <m>Q=\vr(b)</m>, then we divide <m>C</m> into <m>n</m> parts given by <m>\vr_i=\vr(t_i)</m> where <m>t_i=a+ i \Delta t</m> with <m>\Delta t= \frac{b-a}{n}</m>. This divides <m>C</m> into parts that correspond to equal steps in the parameter <m>t</m> which will not correspond to parts with equal length. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our approximation of the length of <m>C</m> will be the sum of the lengths of the vectors <m>\Delta\vr_i = \vr(t_{i})-\vr(t_{i-1})</m>. The length or magnitude of <m>\Delta \vr_i</m> will be given by the distance formula
    <me>
      \sqrt{(x(t_{i}) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_{i}) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_{i}) - z(t_{i-1}))^2}
    </me>
    To make our notation a little more compact, we will write <m>x(t_{i}) - x(t_{i-1})</m> as <m>\Delta x_i</m>, <m>y(t_{i}) - y(t_{i-1})</m> as <m>\Delta y_i</m>, and <m>z(t_{i}) - z(t_{i-1})</m> as <m>\Delta z_i</m>.
    Our approximation of the length of the curve will be calculated by the sum of these lengths which gives
    <md>
      <mrow> L \approx\amp \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Vert\Delta\vr_i\Vert</mrow>
      <mrow>   \approx\amp \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{(\Delta x_i)^2 + (\Delta y_i)^2 + (\Delta z_i)^2} </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since this approximation will approach the actual length as we use smaller and smaller steps, we define the arclength as follows:
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-arclength">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The arclength of <m>C</m>, a curve in space is given by 
        <me>
          \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}{n} \sqrt{(\Delta x_i)^2 + (\Delta y_i)^2 + (\Delta z_i)^2}
        </me>
        
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    You can use the slider on the interact to change the number of segments to be used in the approximation of the arclength of <m>C</m>. Notice that as the number of segments increases, the difference between the actual length of the curve and the line segments gets smaller. You can also see how the sum of the lengths of the blue segments will approach the true length of the curve (<m>\approx 6.3286</m>).

    Since we will want to shrink the step size <m>\Delta t</m> to get better approximations we will rewrite our approximation to allow us to see how our approximation will change as we look at smaller scales (smaller <m>\Delta t</m>).

    This give use the second task in our classic calculus approach (quantify how the approximation changes over a refinement) and this formats our approximation as a Riemann sum. In particular, our approximation is a Riemann sum of the function <m>\sqrt{(\frac{\Delta x_i}{\Delta t})^2 + (\frac{\Delta y_i}{\Delta t})^2 + (\frac{\Delta z_i}{\Delta t})^2}</m> which will simplify greatly when we look at this function as <m>\Delta t</m> goes to 0. Because

      <mrow> y'(t) \amp= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}, \ \text{ and }  </mrow>
      <mrow> z'(t) \amp= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}, </mrow> 
    </md>
    the function we are evaluating in our Riemann sum becomes 
    <me> \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} </me> 
    as <m>\Delta t \rightarrow 0</m> or <m>n\rightarrow \infty</m>. Thus the limit of the Riemann sum from <xref ref="def-arclength" >our definition of arc length</xref> gives a definite integral
    <md>
      <mrow> \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{(\Delta x_i)^2 + (\Delta y_i)^2 + (\Delta z_i)^2} =\amp \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{(\frac{\Delta x_i}{\Delta t})^2 + (\frac{\Delta y_i}{\Delta t})^2 + (\frac{\Delta z_i}{\Delta t})^2} \ \Delta t</mrow>
      <mrow> =\amp \int_a^b  \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} \ dt </mrow>

    The following theorem summarizes how  our definition of arc length can be evaluated as a definite integral based on the 
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Length-of-a-curve">
    <title>The length of a curve</title>
  <p>
    If <m>\vr(t)</m> defines a smooth curve <m>C</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, then the <em>length</em><idx><h>arclength</h></idx> <m>L</m> of <m>C</m> is given by

<p>
  Note that formula <xref ref="eq_9_8_arclength_2"/> applies to curves in any dimensional space. Moreover, this formula has a natural interpretation: if <m>\vr(t)</m> records the position of a moving object, then <m>\vr'(t)=\vv(t)</m> is the object's velocity and <m>\Vert\vr'(t)\Vert</m> its speed. Formula <xref ref="eq_9_8_arclength_2"/> says that we simply integrate the speed of an object traveling over the curve to find the distance traveled by the object, which is the same as the length of the curve, just as in one-variable calculus.

      explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shown below in <xref ref="F_9_8_parametrization">Figure</xref> is a portion of the
      parabola <m>y = x^2/2</m>. Of course, this space curve may be parametrized by
      the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, t^2/2\rangle</m> as shown
      on the left, where we see the location at a few different times <m>t</m>.
      Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve
      is the distance traveled <m>s</m> as we move along the parabola starting at
      the origin. For instance, the right side of <xref ref="F_9_8_parametrization">Figure</xref> shows the points corresponding to various
      values of <m>s</m>. We call this an <em>arc length parametrization</em>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_9_8_parametrization">
      <caption>The parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m> (left) and a
            reparametrization by arc length.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/fig_9_8_param"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an
      interstate highway cutting across a state. One way
      to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the
      highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a
      function <m>\vr</m>. If we encounter an accident or road construction,
      however,
      this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person
      driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is
      like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our
      position on the highway. If we know how far we've traveled along the
      highway, we know exactly where we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can
      modify it to find an arc length parametrization, as we now describe.
      Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued function
      <m>\vr = \vr(t)</m> where <m>t</m> is in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. We define the
      parameter <m>s</m> through the function
      <me>
        s=L(t) = \int_a^t \sqrt{(x'(w))^2 + (y'(w))^2 + (z'(w))^2} \,dw,
      </me>
      which measures the length along the curve from <m>\vr(a)</m> to
      <m>\vr(t)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that
      <men xml:id="eq_9_8_arc_length_prime">
        \frac{ds}{dt} =
          L'(t)=
          \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} = \lvert \vr'(t) \rvert
      </men>
      and so
      <me>
        L(t) = \int_a^t \left| \frac{d}{dw}\vr(w)\right| \,dw.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we assume that <m>\vr'(t)</m> is never 0, then <m>L'(t) &gt; 0</m> for all <m>t</m>
      and <m>s=L(t)</m> is always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we
      stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we move along
      the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>s=L(t)</m> is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means
      we may view the time <m>t</m> as a function of the distance traveled; that
      is, we have the relationship <m>t=L^{-1}(s)</m>. We then obtain the arc length
      parametrization by composing <m>\vr(t)</m> with <m>t=L^{-1}(s)</m> to obtain
      <m>\vr(s)</m>. Let's illustrate this with an example.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_9_8_circle_arc_length">
        <p>
          Consider a circle of
          radius <m>5</m> in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can
          parameterize this circle as
          <me>
            \vr(t) = \langle 5\cos(t), 5\sin(t) \rangle,
          </me>
          where <m>t</m> runs from 0 to <m>2\pi</m>.
          We see that <m>\vr'(t) = \langle -5\sin(t), 5\cos(t) \rangle</m>, and hence
          <m>|\vr'(t)| = 5</m>. It then follows that
          <me>
            s=L(t) = \int_0^t |\vr'(w)|~dw = \int_0^t 5~dw = 5t.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>s=L(t) = 5t</m>, we may solve for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>s</m> to obtain
          <m>t(s)=L^{-1}(s) 
            = s/5</m>. We then find the arc length parametrization by composing
          <me>
            \vr(t(s))=\vr(L^{-1}(s)) = \left\langle 5\cos\left(\frac s5\right),
              5\sin\left(\frac s5\right)\right\rangle.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          More generally, for a circle of radius <m>a</m> centered at the origin, a
          similar computation shows that
          <men xml:id="eq_9_8_circle_arc_length_parameterization">
            \left\langle a\cos\left(\frac sa\right), a\sin\left(\frac sa\right)\right\rangle
          </men>
          is an arc length parametrization.
        </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      Notice that equation <xref ref="eq_9_8_arc_length_prime"/> shows that
      <me>
        \frac{d\vr}{dt} = \frac{d\vr}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{d\vr}{ds}\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert,
      </me>
      so
      <me>
        \left| \frac{d\vr}{ds} \right| = \left|\frac{1}{\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert}\frac{d\vr}{dt} \right| = 1,
      </me>
      which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parameterize by arc length. This is clearly seen in <xref ref="ex_9_8_circle_arc_length">Example</xref> where <m>|\vr'(s)| = 1</m>. It follows that the parameter <m>s</m>
      is the distance traveled along the curve, as shown by:
      <me>
        L(s) = \int_0^s\left|\frac{d}{ds}\vr(w)\right|~dw = \int_0^s1~dw = s.

          Since <m>t \geq 0</m>, we can solve the equation <m>s = t^2+4t</m> (or <m>t^2+4t-s=0</m>) for <m>t</m> to obtain <m>t = \frac{-4 +\sqrt{16+4s}}{2} = -2 + \sqrt{4+s}</m>. So we can parameterize our curve in terms of arc length by

      These examples illustrate a general method. Of course, evaluating an
      arc length integral and finding a formula for the
      inverse of a function can be difficult, so while this process is
      theoretically possible, it is not always practical to parameterize a
      curve in terms of arc length. However, we can guarantee that such a
      parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role
      in the next section.

          The integration process shows that the length <m>L</m> of a smooth curve defined by <m>\vr(t)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is

      <li>
        <p>
          Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We define the curvature <m>\kappa</m> of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or
          <me>
            \kappa = \left\lvert \frac{d\vT}{ds} \right\rvert.
