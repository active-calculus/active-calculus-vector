    <introduction>
    <p>
      Given a space curve, there are two natural geometric questions one might ask: how long is the curve and how much
      does the curve bend? In this section, we answer the first question by developing techniques for measuring the length of a space
      curve and will address the second question in <xref ref="S-VVF-Curvature" />. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Change the preview activity to be an approximation of the arc length using 5 points. Do you think your approximation is above or below the actual length? Ask questions about whether you think an approximation with 10 points would have to be a better approximation? Do you think there is any way to use line segments to overestimate arc length?

        In earlier investigations, we have used integration to calculate quantities such as area, volume, mass, and  work. We are now interested in determining the length of a space curve.

      <p>
        Consider the smooth curve in 3-space defined by the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>, where
        <me>
          \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), t \rangle
        </me>
        for <m>t</m> in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m>. Pictures of the graph of <m>\vr</m> are shown in <xref ref="F-9-8-Arclength">Figure</xref>.
        We will use the integration process to calculate the length of this curve. In this situation we partition the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> into <m>n</m> subintervals of equal length and let <m>0 = t_0 \lt  t_1 \lt  t_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  t_n = b</m> be the endpoints of the subintervals. We then approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with some related quantity that we can compute. In this case, we approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with the length of the segment connecting the endpoints. <xref ref="F-9-8-Arclength">Figure</xref> illustrates the process in three different instances using increasing values of <m>n</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Arc Length</title>
    <p>
      Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by
      the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t)
      \rangle.</m>
      <xref ref="PA_9_8">Preview Activity</xref> shows that to approximate the
      length of the curve defined by <m>\vr(t)</m> as the values of <m>t</m> run over
      an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, we partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m>
      subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta t</m>, with <m>a = t_0 \lt  t_1 \lt  \cdots
      \lt  t_n = b</m> as the endpoints of the subintervals. On each subinterval,
      we approximate the length of the curve by the length of the line
      segment connecting the endpoints. The points on the curve
      corresponding to <m>t = t_{i-1}</m> and <m>t = t_i</m> are <m>(x(t_{i-1}),
      y(t_{i-1}), z(t_{i-1}))</m> and <m>(x(t_i), y(t_i), z(t_i))</m>, respectively,
      so the length of the line segment connecting these points is
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) -
          z(t_{i-1}))^2}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an
      approximation to the length <m>L</m> of the curve:
      <me>
        L \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) -
          y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We now want to take the limit of this sum as <m>n</m> goes to infinity, but in its present form it
      might be difficult to see how. We first introduce <m>\Delta t</m> by multiplying by <m>\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}</m>, and see that
      <md>
        <mrow>L \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{(\Delta t)^2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      To get the difference quotients under the radical, we use properties of the square root function to see further that
      <md>
        <mrow>L \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left[(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})^2\right] \frac{1}{(\Delta t)^2}} \Delta t</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left(\frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2} \Delta t.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that as <m>n \to \infty</m> we also have <m>\Delta t \to 0</m>. Since
      <md>
        <mrow> x'(t) \amp = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t},</mrow> 
        <mrow> y'(t) \amp = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}, \ \text{ and }  </mrow>
        <mrow> z'(t) \amp \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}, </mrow> 
      </md>

      we see that
          <me>\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left(\frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2} \Delta t
          </me>
          is equal to 
        <me>
           \int_a^b \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} \, dt.
         </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Noting further that
      <me>
        |\vr'(t)| = \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2},
      </me>
      we can rewrite our arclength formula in a more succinct form as follows.

      the object's velocity and <m>|\vr'(t)|</m> its speed. Formula
      <xref ref="eq_9_8_arclength_2"/> says that we simply integrate the speed of
      an object traveling over the curve to find the distance traveled by
      the object, which is the same as the length of the curve,
      just as in one-variable calculus.

  <subsection>
    <title>Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length</title>
    <p>
      In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the
      expression for the length of a curve enables us to find a natural
      parametrization of space curves in terms of arc length, as we now
      explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shown below in <xref ref="F_9_8_parametrization">Figure</xref> is a portion of the
      parabola <m>y = x^2/2</m>. Of course, this space curve may be parametrized by
      the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, t^2/2\rangle</m> as shown
      on the left, where we see the location at a few different times <m>t</m>.
      Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve
      is the distance traveled <m>s</m> as we move along the parabola starting at
      the origin. For instance, the right side of <xref ref="F_9_8_parametrization">Figure</xref> shows the points corresponding to various
      values of <m>s</m>. We call this an <em>arc length parametrization</em>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_9_8_parametrization">
      <caption>The parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m> (left) and a
            reparametrization by arc length.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/fig_9_8_param"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an
      interstate highway cutting across a state. One way
      to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the
      highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a
      function <m>\vr</m>. If we encounter an accident or road construction,
      however,
      this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person
      driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is
      like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our
      position on the highway. If we know how far we've traveled along the
      highway, we know exactly where we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can
      modify it to find an arc length parametrization, as we now describe.
      Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued function
      <m>\vr = \vr(t)</m> where <m>t</m> is in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. We define the
      parameter <m>s</m> through the function
      <me>
        s=L(t) = \int_a^t \sqrt{(x'(w))^2 + (y'(w))^2 + (z'(w))^2} \,dw,
      </me>
      which measures the length along the curve from <m>\vr(a)</m> to
      <m>\vr(t)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that
      <men xml:id="eq_9_8_arc_length_prime">
        \frac{ds}{dt} =
          L'(t)=
          \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} = \lvert \vr'(t) \rvert
      </men>
      and so
      <me>
        L(t) = \int_a^t \left| \frac{d}{dw}\vr(w)\right| \,dw.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we assume that <m>\vr'(t)</m> is never 0, then <m>L'(t) &gt; 0</m> for all <m>t</m>
      and <m>s=L(t)</m> is always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we
      stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we move along
      the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>s=L(t)</m> is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means
      we may view the time <m>t</m> as a function of the distance traveled; that
      is, we have the relationship <m>t=L^{-1}(s)</m>. We then obtain the arc length
      parametrization by composing <m>\vr(t)</m> with <m>t=L^{-1}(s)</m> to obtain
      <m>\vr(s)</m>. Let's illustrate this with an example.
    </p>

            \vr(t) = \langle 5\cos(t), 5\sin(t) \rangle,
          </me>
          where <m>t</m> runs from 0 to <m>2\pi</m>.
          We see that <m>\vr'(t) = \langle -5\sin(t), 5\cos(t) \rangle</m>, and hence
          <m>|\vr'(t)| = 5</m>. It then follows that
          <me>
            s=L(t) = \int_0^t |\vr'(w)|~dw = \int_0^t 5~dw = 5t.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>s=L(t) = 5t</m>, we may solve for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>s</m> to obtain
          <m>t(s)=L^{-1}(s) 
            = s/5</m>. We then find the arc length parametrization by composing
          <me>
            \vr(t(s))=\vr(L^{-1}(s)) = \left\langle 5\cos\left(\frac s5\right),
              5\sin\left(\frac s5\right)\right\rangle.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          More generally, for a circle of radius <m>a</m> centered at the origin, a
          similar computation shows that
          <men xml:id="eq_9_8_circle_arc_length_parameterization">
            \left\langle a\cos\left(\frac sa\right), a\sin\left(\frac sa\right)\right\rangle
          </men>
          is an arc length parametrization.
        </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      Notice that equation <xref ref="eq_9_8_arc_length_prime"/> shows that
      <me>
        \frac{d\vr}{dt} = \frac{d\vr}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{d\vr}{ds}\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert,
      </me>
      so
      <me>
        \left| \frac{d\vr}{ds} \right| = \left|\frac{1}{\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert}\frac{d\vr}{dt} \right| = 1,
      </me>
      which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parameterize by arc length. This is clearly seen in <xref ref="ex_9_8_circle_arc_length">Example</xref> where <m>|\vr'(s)| = 1</m>. It follows that the parameter <m>s</m>
      is the distance traveled along the curve, as shown by:
      <me>
        L(s) = \int_0^s\left|\frac{d}{ds}\vr(w)\right|~dw = \int_0^s1~dw = s.

      A little more complicated example is the following.

        <p>
          Since <m>t \geq 0</m>, we can solve the equation <m>s = t^2+4t</m> (or <m>t^2+4t-s=0</m>) for <m>t</m> to obtain <m>t = \frac{-4 +\sqrt{16+4s}}{2} = -2 + \sqrt{4+s}</m>. So we can parameterize our curve in terms of arc length by

      These examples illustrate a general method. Of course, evaluating an
      arc length integral and finding a formula for the
      inverse of a function can be difficult, so while this process is
      theoretically possible, it is not always practical to parameterize a
      curve in terms of arc length. However, we can guarantee that such a
      parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role
      in the next section.

      In the next activity, we will look at several measurements as we consider race car drivers completing one lap around the track seen in <xref ref="racetrack_plot">Figure</xref>.

        All of the drivers in our race are going the same way around the track, all start at the same location at <m>t=0</m>, all complete one lap of the track, and all of the cars have perfect grip of the road (the race cars are never sliding). The picture of the racetrack above is given so you have an example to help you think about the tasks in this problem, not because any particular feature of the track needs to be considered for the following activity.

      <title>Is it a property of the driver or the road?</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this activity, we want to determine if the different measurements that are described are a property of the driver or the road. A measurement is a property of the driver if the value(s) of that measurement <alert>can</alert> be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers <alert>must</alert> have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack).

            Let's start by looking at a couple of easy measurements. Is the time elapsed a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          Remember that we are NOT asking if the driver or road can control time. We are asking if the elapsed time is the same for all drivers at a fixed point on the racetrack or if drivers can have a different elapsed time to a particular location on the racetrack.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            You should make sure you understand that the measurements for different drivers must be made at the same location on the track, as stated above. Your explanation sentence may sound a little silly.

          The integration process shows that the length <m>L</m> of a smooth curve defined by <m>\vr(t)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is
          <me>
            L = \int_a^b |\vr'(t)| \, dt.

        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We define the curvature <m>\kappa</m> of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or
          <me>
            \kappa = \left\lvert \frac{d\vT}{ds} \right\rvert.
