      In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>. <idx><h>locally linear</h></idx> In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function around a point, the graph  will look like the tangent line to the function at that point.

      Linear functions (of the form <m>f(x)=ax+b</m>) play important roles in single variable calculus and are useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will study curves in space and we will see that connection between local linearity and differentiability exists for curves in three (or more!) dimensions. Additionally, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space, as these correspond to graphs of linear expressions in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>. (Recall that a function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less than or equal to 1. For example, <m>x-1</m> defines a single variable linear expression and <m>x+y+2</m> a two variable linear expression. But <m>xy</m> is not linear since it has degree two, the sum of the degrees of its factors.) We will study planes and lines in <m>\R^3</m> as flat graphs before we look at curves and surfaces in general. In your study of 1-variable functions, you probably worked with ideas like slope, direction, and measuring change using lines several times before you generalized those ideas for a curve in general. Similarly, we will want to have a good idea about how we talk about direction and measuring change along flat objects in <m>\R^3</m> (lines and planes) before we start generalizing to curved objects.

       <p>
          We will start our work on lines by considering some familiar ideas in <m>\R^2</m> but from a new perspective. You are probably familiar with equations of lines in the <m>xy</m>-plane in the form <m>y = mx+b</m>, where <m>m</m> is the slope of the line and <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines that is useful in the <m>xy</m>-plane and higher dimensions. To begin, consider the line through the point <m>(2,-1)</m> with slope <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> as shown in <xref ref="PA-Lineplot1">Figure</xref>.

            Suppose we increase <m>x</m> by 1 from the point <m>(2,-1)</m>. How does the <m>y</m>-value change? What is the point on the line with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>3</m>?

        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            As we increase <m>x</m> by 1, the <m>y</m>-value increases by <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>. The point on the line with the <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>3</m> is <m>(3, -\frac{1}{3})</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If a line has a slope of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>, this means that an increase of 3 in the <m>x</m>-direction results in increase of 2 in the <m>y</m>-direction. If we scale this to a one-unit rate of change, an increase of 1 unit in the <m>x</m>-direction results in an increase of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction. From the point <m>(2, -1)</m> to the point with an <m>x</m>-value of 3, this requires a 1 unit increase in the rate of change in the <m>x</m>-direction, which results in an increase of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction. Therefore, the point on the line with an <m>x</m>-coordinate of <m>3</m> is <m>(3, -1 + \frac{2}{3}) = (3, -\frac{1}{3})</m>.

        <answer>
          <p>
            As we decrease <m>x</m> by 3.25 from <m>(2, -1)</m>, the <m>y</m>-value decreases by <m>\frac{13}{6}</m>. The point on the line with the <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>-1.25</m> is <m>(-1.25, -\frac{19}{6})</m>.

            Remember that the horizontal component of a vector describes the <q>run</q> and the vertical component measures the <q>rise</q> of the vector. So the slope of the line is related to <em>any</em> vector whose <m>y</m>-component divided by the <m>x</m>-component is the slope of the line. For the line in this activity, we might use the vector <m>\langle 3,2 \rangle</m> to describe the direction of the line. Explain why the terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>, where
            <me>
              \vr(t) = \langle 2,-1 \rangle + \langle 3,2 \rangle t,

            The terminal point of the vector <m>\langle 2, -1 \rangle</m> is the point <m>(2, -1)</m>.

If we start at the terminal point of <m>\langle 2, -1</m>, which is the point <m>(2, -1)</m>, and add scalar multiples of the vector <m>\langle 3, 2 \rangle</m>, the terminal point of these scalar vectors will trace out the graph of the line through the point <m>(2, -1)</m> with a slope of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Lines in Space</title>
    <p>
      The way most people draw a line is more connected to the ideas in <xref ref="PA_9_5" /> than slope or algebraic forms. Take a minute and draw a plot of the line described by <m>x+y-1=0</m>. Look at how to hide the next part. You may have done some algebra or other calculation to get to slope intercept form or another familiar algebraic structure, but when you went to draw the line you almost certainly did the following steps 
      <ol>
        <li>found a point to start your plot (maybe the y-intercept)</li>
        <li>found a second point on your plot (perhaps using the slope to find the second point)</li>
        <li>drew a line segment from the first point to the second, then extended the line past the second point to the end of you plot</li>
        <li>went back to the first point and extended the line in the direction opposite of the second point</li>
      </ol>
      In other words, you made a starting point, extended indefinitely far in a particular direction, then added in the opposite direction. This is the essence of the general description for a line we will give below. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set of points satisfying the equation
      <me>
        y = mx + b,
      </me>
      for some constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. The value of <m>m</m> (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept and anchors the line to a location on the <m>y</m>-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to the vector <m>\langle 1, m \rangle</m>, which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in <xref ref="Lineplot3">Figure</xref>. Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point <m>P</m> and a direction <m>\vv</m>, as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space (<m>\R^n</m>) to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a line works in <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>n</m>.

Here, <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> is the fixed vector shown in blue, while the direction vector <m>\vv</m> is the vector parallel to the vector shown in red (that is, the red vector represents <m>t \vv</m>, and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the green vector). In other words, the tips (terminal points) of the green vectors (the vectors of the form <m>\overrightarrow{OP} + t \vv</m>) trace out the line as <m>t</m> changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in <xref ref="eq_9_5_lines_1"/> define a linear function <m>\vr</m> in space of the following form, which is valid and gives some geometric intuition into each part for in any dimension.

      Lines in the <m>xy</m>-plane are commonly described using the slope-intercept equation <m>y=mx + b</m>. The vector form of the line, as described above, is an
      alternative way to represent lines that has the two advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines, whose slope <m>m</m> is not defined, using a vertical direction vector. For example, the vertical line described by <m>x=2</m> could be described in vector form with a direction vector like <m>\vv=\langle 0, 1\rangle</m>, giving <m>\vr(t)= \langle 2,0\rangle +t \langle 0,1\rangle</m>. The second advantage of the vector form of a line is that this
      description of lines works in <em>any</em> dimension whereas the concept of slope of a line does not generalize to three or more dimensions.

              We know that the lines are parallel to each other from part <m>c</m>.

            Subtract <m>\langle -5, 0, 3 \rangle</m> from both sides to get <m>\langle 6, 2, 2 \rangle = t * \langle 6, 2, 2 \rangle</m>. This equation is true when <m>t = 1</m>. Therefore, <m>\vr(t)</m> and <m>\vs(t)</m> are the same lines.

    <title>The Parametric Equations of a Line</title>
    <p>
      The vector form of a line, <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_9_5_line_vect"/>, describes a line as the set of terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If we view this vector equation in terms components,
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle, \ \ \ \vr_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle, \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \vv = \langle a, b, c \rangle
      </me>
      then we can equate the components on both sides of <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 +
      t\vv</m> to obtain the following
      <me>
        x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ \ \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ z(t) = z_0 +
        ct
      </me>
      These equations describe the coordinates of the points on the line separately where each is coordinate is a function of <m>t</m>. The variable <m>t</m> represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a <em>parameter</em>. In particular, we use the following language.

    <p>
      We should note here that there are <em>many</em> different parametric equations for the same
      line. For example, choosing another point <m>P</m> on the line or another direction vector <m>\vv</m> produces another set of parametric equations. In many physical applications, it is useful to think of <m>t</m> as a time parameter and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a particular way to walk along the line; there are, of course, many possible ways to walk along the same line. In mathematical terms, we say that the parameterization of a line is not unique.

      Before we move on to our discussion of planes, we will talk about some terminology that may help in describing some features and measurements later. A line is a one-dimensional, flat graph in three (or <m>n</m>) dimensions. We say the line is a one-dimensional graph because there is only one direction to go and stay on the graph (forward/backward). We say that a line is flat because the direction you are allowed to go doesn't change as you move along the graph. Note that flat does not mean horizontal. A circle would be another example of a one-dimensional graph that can be drawn in two or more dimensional space (because there is only one direction to move along the circle) but is not flat since the direction you go to stay on the figure changes as you move along the graph. As we will see below, a plane in three dimensional space is an example of a flat, two-dimensional graph. If you were an ant on a plane, you would have two dimensions you can move in while staying on the graph (forward/backward or left/right), but the direction(s) that the graph extends does not change when you move locations on the plane.

      Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions.

      As shown in <xref ref="fundamentalplanewithvector"/>, any vector in a plane with <m>x= \text{constant}</m> will be orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 1,0,0 \rangle</m>, any vector in a plane with <m>y= \text{constant}</m> will be orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m>, and any vector in a plane with <m>z= \text{constant}</m> will be orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 0,0,1 \rangle</m>.

      Like the definition of a line, the definition of a plane given above uses a starting point and a vector as the critical pieces of information. For a line, you begin at the starting point and move as much as you want parallel to the given vector (the direction vector). For a plane, you begin at the starting point and move as much as you want orthogonal to the given vector (the normal vector). For a line, you move only in the direction of the given vector whereas on a plane you cannot move at all in the direction of the given vector.

    <p>
      The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that <m>\vn=\langle a,b,c\rangle</m>, <m>P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m>, and that <m>Q=(x,y,z)</m> is an arbitrary point on the plane. Since the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> lies in the plane, it must be perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>. This means that
      <md>
        <mrow>0 =\mathstrut \amp  \vn\cdot\overrightarrow{PQ}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vn\cdot \big(\langle x,y,z \rangle - \langle x_0, y_0,

      The fixed vector <m>\vn</m> perpendicular to the plane is frequently called a <em>normal vector</em> to the plane. We may now summarize our new equation for a plane.

      We may take the scalar equation of a plane a little further and note that since
      <me>
        a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0,
      </me>
      it equivalently follows that
      <me>
        ax + by + cz = ax_0+by_0+cz_0.
      </me>
      That is, we may write an equation of a plane as <m>ax+by+cz = d</m> where <m>d = \vn\cdot\langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        If we would like to describe the plane passing through the point <m>P=(4,-2,1)</m> and perpendicular to the vector <m>\vn = \langle 1, 2, 1 \rangle</m>, we have
        <me>
          \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle x,y,z\rangle = \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle 4,-2,1\rangle

        or
        <me>
          x + 2y + z = 1.
        </me>
        Notice that the coefficients of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> in this description give a vector perpendicular to the plane.

            The angle between the two planes is equal to the angle between the normal vectors. <m>\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vn\cdot\vm}{|\vn||\vm|}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{(-8)(-3) + (0)(4) + (-2)(2)}{|\sqrt{68}||\sqrt{29}|}\right) = 62.23^{\circ}</m>.

          While lines in <m>\R^3</m> do not have a slope, like lines in <m>\R^2</m> they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector.  Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.

          Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line.  In particular, the terminal points of the vector <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> define a linear function <m>\vr</m> in space through the terminal point of the vector <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vv</m>, tracing out a line in space.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.

          If <m>P_1</m>, <m>P_2</m>, and <m>P_3</m> are non-collinear points in space, the vectors <m>\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}</m> and and <m>\overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</m>  are vectors in the plane and the vector <m>\vn = \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</m> is a normal vector to the plane. So any point <m>P</m> in the plane satisfies the equation <m>\overrightarrow{PP_1} \cdot \vn = 0</m>.  If we let <m>P = (x,y,z)</m>, <m>\vn = \langle a,b,c \rangle</m> be the normal vector, and <m>P_1 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, we can also represent the plane with the equation
          <me>
            a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0.
          </me>
