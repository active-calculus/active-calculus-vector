  <introduction>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>. <idx><h>locally linear</h></idx> In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function at a point, the graph looks like the tangent line to the function at that point. Linear functions played important roles in single variable calculus, useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (see Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (see Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will soon study curves in space; differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear as well. In addition, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space, as these define the linear functions in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>. (Recall that a function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less than or equal to 1. For example, <m>x</m> defines a single variable linear function and <m>x+y</m> a two variable linear function, but <m>xy</m> is not linear since it has degree two, the sum of the degress of its factors.) We begin our work by considering some familiar ideas in <m>\R^2</m> but from a new perspective.

       <p>
          We are familiar with equations of lines in the plane in the form <m>y = mx+b</m>, where <m>m</m> is the slope of the line and <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines that we can use not only in the plane, but in higher dimensions as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin, consider the line through the point <m>(2,-1)</m> with slope <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> as shown in <xref ref="F_9_5_PA_1">Figure</xref>.

              Observe that the slope of the line is related to any vector whose <m>y</m>-component divided by the <m>x</m>-component is the slope of the line. For the line in this exercise, we might use the vector <m>\langle 3,2 \rangle</m>, which describes the direction of the line. Explain why the terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>, where
              <me>
                \vr(t) = \langle 2,-1 \rangle + \langle 3,2 \rangle t,
              </me>

                If a line has a slope of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>, this means that an increase of 3 in the <m>x</m>-direction results in increase of 2 in the <m>y</m>-direction.

From the point <m>(2, -1)</m> to the point with an <m>x</m>-value of 3, this requires a 1 unit increase in the rate of change in the <m>x</m>-direction, which results in an increase of <m>\frac{2}{3}\</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction. Therefore, the point on the line with an <m>x</m>-coordinate of <m>3</m> is <m>(3, -1 + \frac{2}{3}) = (3, -\frac{1}{3})</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Lines in Space</title>
    <p>
      In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set
      of points satisfying the equation
      <me>
        y = mx + b,
      </me>
      for some constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. The value of <m>m</m> (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept and anchors the line to a location on the <m>y</m>-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to the vector <m>\langle 1, m \rangle</m>, which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in <xref ref="F_9_5_line">Figure</xref>. Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point <m>P</m> and a direction <m>\vv</m>, as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a line works in <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>n</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The fixed vector <m>\vv</m> in the definition is called a
      <em>direction vector</em><idx><h>line</h><h>direction vector</h></idx> for the line. As
      we saw in <xref ref="PA_9_5">Preview Activity</xref>, to find an equation for a
      line through point <m>P</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, observe that
      any vector parallel to <m>\vv</m> will have the form <m>t \vv</m> for some
      scalar <m>t</m>. So, any vector emanating from the point <m>P</m> in a direction
      parallel to the vector <m>\vv</m> will be of the form
      <men xml:id="eq_9_5_lines_1">

Here, <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> is the fixed vector shown in blue, while the direction vector <m>\vv</m> is the vector parallel to the vector shown in green (that is, the green vector represents <m>t\vv</m>, and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the magenta vector). In other words, the tips (terminal points) of the magenta vectors (the vectors of the form <m>\overrightarrow{OP} + t\vv</m>) trace out the line as <m>t</m> changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in
      <xref ref="eq_9_5_lines_1"/> define a linear function <m>\vr</m> in space of the
      following form, which is valid in any dimension.

    <p>
      Of course, it is common to
      represent lines in the plane using the slope-intercept equation <m>y=mx
      + b</m>. The vector form of the line, described above, is an
      alternative way to represent lines that has the following two
      advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent
      vertical lines, whose slope <m>m</m> is not defined, using a vertical
      direction vector, such as <m>\vv=\langle 0, 1\rangle</m>. Second, this
      description of lines works in any dimension even though
      there is no concept of the slope of a line in more than two dimensions.

    <title>The Parametric Equations of a Line</title>

      The vector form of a line, <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> in
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_9_5_line_vect"/>, describes a line as the set of
      terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If we write this in terms of
      components letting
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle, \ \ \ \vr_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle, \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \vv = \langle a, b, c \rangle,
      </me>
      then we can equate the components on both sides of <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 +
      t\vv</m> to obtain the equations
      <me>
        x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ \ \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ z(t) = z_0 +
        ct,
      </me>
      which describe the coordinates of the points on the line. The
      variable <m>t</m> represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a
      <em>parameter</em>. In particular, we use the following language.

      Notice that there are many different parametric equations for the same
      line. For example, choosing another point <m>P</m> on the line or
      another direction vector <m>\vv</m> produces another set of parametric
      equations. It is sometimes useful to think of <m>t</m> as a time parameter
      and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at
      each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a
      particular walk taken along the line; there are, of course,
      many possible ways to walk along a line.

    <title>Planes in Space</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions. We studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them in <xref ref="S-Precalc-3Dcoord">Section</xref>. Each of those planes had one of the variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m> equal to a constant. We can note that any vector in a plane with <m>x</m> constant is orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 1,0,0 \rangle</m>, any vector in a plane with <m>y</m> constant is orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m>, and any vector in a plane with <m>z</m> constant is orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 0,0,1 \rangle</m>. This idea works in general to define a plane.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A
          <term>plane</term><idx><h>plane</h><h>definition</h></idx> <m>p</m> in space is the set of
          all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point
          <m>P_0</m> perpendicular to a fixed vector <m>\vn</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F_9_5_plane_normal">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <figure xml:id="F_9_5_plane_normal">
      <caption>A point <m>P_0</m> on a plane <m>p</m> with a normal vector <m>\vn</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/fig_9_5_plane_normal"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that <m>\vn=\langle a,b,c\rangle</m>, <m>P_0 =
      (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m>, and that <m>P=(x,y,z)</m> is an arbitrary point on the plane.
      Since the vector <m>\overrightarrow{P_0P}</m> lies in
      the plane, it must be perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>. This means that
      <md>
        <mrow>0 =\mathstrut \amp  \vn\cdot\overrightarrow{P_0P}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vn\cdot \big(\langle x,y,z \rangle - \langle x_0, y_0,
            z_0\rangle\big)</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vn \cdot \langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0 \rangle</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      The fixed vector <m>\vn</m> perpendicular to the plane is frequently called
      a <em>normal vector</em> to the plane. We may now summarize as follows.

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    </assemblage>

    

    <p>
      We may take the scalar equation of a plane a little further and note that since
      <me>
        a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0,
      </me>
      it equivalently follows that
      <me>
        ax + by + cz = ax_0+by_0+cz_0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, we may write an equation of a plane as <m>ax+by+cz = d</m> where
      <m>d = \vn\cdot\langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, if we would like to describe the plane passing through
      the point <m>P_0=(4, -2,1)</m> and perpendicular to the vector <m>\vn =
      \langle 1, 2, 1 \rangle</m>, we have
      <me>
        \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle x,y,z\rangle =
          \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle 4,-2,1\rangle
      </me>
      or
      <me>
        x + 2y + z = 1.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the coefficients of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> in this description
      give a vector perpendicular to the plane. For instance, if we are
      presented with the plane
      <me>
        -2x + y - 3z = 4,
      </me>
      we know that <m>\vn = \langle -2, 1, -3\rangle</m> is a vector
      perpendicular to the plane.

      Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three
      non-collinear points in space determine a plane.
      Consider three points <m>P_0</m>, <m>P_1</m>, and <m>P_2</m> in space, not all lying
      on the same line as shown in <xref ref="F_9_5_Plane">Figure</xref>.

      Observe that the vectors <m>\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}</m> and

      we obtain a normal vector to the plane <m>p</m>.

          While lines in <m>\R^3</m> do not have a slope, like lines in <m>\R^2</m> they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector.  Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line.  In particular, the terminal points of the vector <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> define a linear function <m>\vr</m> in space through the terminal point of the vector <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vv</m>, tracing out a line in space.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>P_1</m>, <m>P_2</m>, and <m>P_3</m> are non-collinear points in space, the vectors <m>\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}</m> and and <m>\overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</m>  are vectors in the plane and the vector <m>\vn = \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</m> is a normal vector to the plane. So any point <m>P</m> in the plane satisfies the equation <m>\overrightarrow{PP_1} \cdot \vn = 0</m>.  If we let <m>P = (x,y,z)</m>, <m>\vn = \langle a,b,c \rangle</m> be the normal vector, and <m>P_1 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, we can also represent the plane with the equation
          <me>
            a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0.
          </me>

Using parametric equations, this is equal to <m>x(t) = 1 - 3t, y(t) = 2 - t, z(t) = -1 - t</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To find the corresponding t-values for each point, set each coordinate equal to the corresponding parametric equation. <m>1 = 1 - 3t, 2 = 2 - t, -1 = -1 -t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 0</m>. For <m>P_2, -2 = 1 - 3t, 1 = 2 - t, -2 = -1 - t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 1</m>. 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  All the points between <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> will have <m>t</m>-values between <m>t = 0</m> and <m>t = 1</m>. Therefore, the line segment between <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> is defined for <m>0 \leq t \leq 1</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  For <m>P_3, 7 = 1 - 3t, 4 = 2 - t, 1 = -1 -t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = -2</m>. For <m>P_4, -8 = 1 - 3t, -1 = 2 - t, -4 = -1 - t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 3</m>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore, line segment between points <m>(7, 4, 1)</m> and <m>(-8, -1, -4)</m> is defined by <m>-2 \leq t \leq 3</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>\overrightarrow{QR} = \langle 15, -6, -20 \rangle</m>. We need to find a scalar (direction) vector in the direction of <m>\langle 15, -6, -20 \rangle</m>. If point <m>Q</m> is the initial point, then <m>\vr(t) = \langle -11, 4, 27 \rangle + t * \langle 15v, -6v, -20v \rangle</m>. When <m>t = 2, \langle 4, -2, 7 \rangle = \langle -11, 4, 27 \rangle + (2) * \langle 15v, -6v, -20v \rangle</m>. Solve for <m>v</m> to get <m>v = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore, <m>\vr(t) = \langle -11, 4, 27 \rangle + t * \langle 15 * \frac{1}{2} , -6 * \frac{1}{2}, -20 * \frac{1}{2} \rangle</m>. This cooresponds to parametric equations <m>x(t) = -11 + \frac{15}{2}t, y(t) = 4 - 3t, z(t) = 27 -10t</m>.
