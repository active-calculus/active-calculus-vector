              How are the first-order partial derivatives of a function <m>f</m> of
                the independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> defined?

            <p>
              Given a function
                <m>f</m> of the independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, what do the first-order partial derivatives <m>\frac{\partial
                  f}{\partial x}</m> and <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}</m> tell us about <m>f</m>?

    <introduction>
    <p>
      The derivative plays a central role in first semester calculus
      because it provides important information about a function. Thinking
      graphically, for instance, the derivative at a point tells us the
      slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. In addition, the
      derivative at a point also provides the instantaneous rate of change of
      the function with respect to changes in the independent variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we can still ask how fast the function is changing, though we have to be careful about what we mean. Thinking
      graphically again, we can try to measure how steep the graph of the function is in a particular direction. Alternatively, we may want to know how fast a function's output changes in response to a change in one of the inputs. Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for addressing issues such as these. Preview

  <subsection>
    <title>First-Order Partial Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S-9-1-Functions">Section</xref>, we studied the behavior
      of a function of two or more variables by considering the <em>traces</em>
      of the function. Recall that in one example, we considered the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32},
      </me>
      which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a
      projectile launched with an initial
      speed of <m>x</m> feet per second at an angle <m>y</m> radians to the
      horizontal. The graph of this function is given again on the left in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_y">Figure</xref>. Moreover, if we fix the angle <m>y = 0.6</m>, we may view the trace <m>f(x,0.6)</m> as a
      function of <m>x</m> alone, as seen at right in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_y">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_2_trace_y">
      <caption>Left: The trace of <m>z=\frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32}</m> with <m>y = 0.6</m>.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
      <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_y_a"/>
      <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_y"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its
      derivative just as we did in the first semester of calculus. With
      <m>y=0.6</m>, we have
      <me>
        f(x,0.6) = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{32}x^2,
      </me>
      and therefore
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x,0.6)] = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{16}x.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      When <m>x=150</m>, this gives
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x,0.6)]|_{x=150} = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{16}150 \approx
        8.74~\mbox{feet per feet per second} ,
      </me>
      which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_y">Figure</xref>. Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous
      rate of change implies that if we increase the initial speed of the projectile by
      one foot per second, we expect the horizontal distance traveled to
      increase by approximately 8.74 feet if we hold the launch angle constant at <m>0.6</m> radians.
    </p>

    <p>
      By holding <m>y</m> fixed and differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>, we
      obtain the first-order <em>partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to
      <m>x</m></em>. Denoting this partial derivative as <m>f_x</m>, we have seen that
      <me>
        f_x(150, 0.6) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x,0.6)|_{x=150} = \lim_{h\to
          0}\frac{f(150+h, 0.6) - f(150, 0.6)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, we have
      <me>
        f_x(a,b) = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(a+h, b)-f(a,b)}{h},
      </me>
      provided this limit exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, <m>x=150</m> as shown
      in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_x">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_2_trace_x">
      <caption>The trace of <m>z=\frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32}</m> with <m>x = 150</m>.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
      <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_x_a"/>
      <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_x"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      This gives
      <me>
        f(150, y) = \frac{150^2}{32}\sin(2y),
      </me>
      and therefore
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dy}[f(150,y)] = \frac{150^2}{16}\cos(2y).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we evaluate this quantity at <m>y=0.6</m>, we have
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dy}[f(150,y)]|_{y=0.6} = \frac{150^2}{16}\cos(1.2) \approx 509.5
        ~\mbox{feet per radian} .
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown
      on the right in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_x">Figure</xref>. Thinking of the
      derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, we expect that the
      range of the projectile increases by 509.5 feet for every radian we increase the launch angle
      <m>y</m> if we keep the initial speed of the projectile constant at 150 feet per second.
    </p>

    <p>
      By holding <m>x</m> fixed and differentiating with respect to <m>y</m>, we
      obtain the first-order <em>partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m></em>.
      As before, we denote this partial derivative as <m>f_y</m> and write
      <me>
        f_y(150, 0.6) = \frac{d}{dy}f(150,y)|_{y=0.6} = \lim_{h\to
          0}\frac{f(150, 0.6+h) - f(150, 0.6)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      As with the partial derivative with respect to <m>x</m>, we may express this quantity more generally at an arbitrary point <m>(a,b)</m>.

      As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as
      the derivative of a one-variable function defined by fixing one of the
      coordinates. In addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new
      function of the point <m>(x,y)</m>, just as the derivative <m>f'(x)</m> defines
      a new function of <m>x</m> in single-variable calculus. Due to the connection between one-variable
      derivatives and partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style
      notation to denote partial derivatives by writing
      <me>
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a, b) = f_x(a,b),
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a, b) = f_y(a,b).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      To calculate the partial
      derivative <m>f_x</m>, we hold <m>y</m> fixed and thus we treat <m>y</m> as a
      constant. In Leibniz notation, observe that
      <me>
        \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (x) = 1
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(y) = 0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      To see the contrast between how we calculate single variable derivatives and partial derivatives, and the difference between the notations <m>\frac{d}{dx}[ \ ]</m> and <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[ \ ]</m>, observe that
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  \frac{d}{dx}[3x^2 - 2x + 3] = 3\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] - 2\frac{d}{dx}[x]
          + \frac{d}{dx}[3] = 3\cdot 2x - 2,</mrow>
        <mrow>\mbox{and} \  \amp  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2y - xy + 2y] =
          y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2] -
          y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x]
          + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[2y] = y\cdot 2x - y</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, computing partial derivatives is straightforward: we use the standard rules of single variable calculus, but do so while holding one (or more) of the variables constant.

    <title>Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a
      geometric interpretation as the slope of the line tangent to the graph
      at a given point. Similarly, we have seen that the partial
      derivatives measure the slope of a line tangent to a trace of a
      function of two variables as shown in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_tangent">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_2_trace_tangent">

      <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_tangent_x"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall
      that the difference quotient <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> for a function
      <m>f</m> of a single variable <m>x</m> at a point where <m>x=a</m> tells us the
      average rate of change of <m>f</m> over the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>, while the
      derivative <m>f'(a)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at
      <m>x=a</m>.
      We can use these same concepts to
      explain the meanings of the partial derivatives in context.

    <title>Using tables and contours to estimate partial
      derivatives</title>
    <p>
      Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either
      a table of data or a contour plot.
      In single variable calculus, we saw how we can use the difference
      quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic
      formula, we only know the value of the
      function at a few points.
      The same idea applies to partial derivatives.

In <xref ref="T_10_2_wind_chill">Table</xref>, the wind chill <m>w</m>, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed <m>v</m>, measured in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature <m>T</m>, also measured in degrees Fahrenheit.

          If <m>f=f(x,y)</m> is a function of two variables, there are two first
            order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>: the partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m>,
          <me>
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = f_x(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0}
                  \frac{f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)}{h},
          </me>
          and the partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m>,
          <me>
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = f_y(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0}
                  \frac{f(x,y+h) - f(x,y)}{h},
          </me>
          where each partial derivative exists only at those points <m>(x,y)</m> for which
                the limit exists.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The partial derivative <m>f_x(a,b)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate of
              change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> at <m>(x,y) = (a,b)</m> when <m>y</m> is fixed at <m>b</m>.  Geometrically,
              the partial derivative <m>f_x(a,b)</m> tells us the slope of the line
              tangent to the <m>y=b</m> trace of the function <m>f</m> at the point
              <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>.

                  Often we are given certain graphical information about a function instead of a rule. We can use that information to approximate partial derivatives. For example, suppose that we are given a contour plot of the kinetic energy function (as in <xref ref="F_10_2_pd_contour">Figure</xref>) instead of a formula. Use this contour plot to approximate <m>f_x(4,5)</m> and <m>f_y(4,5)</m> as best you can. Compare to your calculations from earlier parts of this exercise.

          <p>
            Recall from single variable calculus that, given the derivative of a single variable function and an initial condition, we can integrate to find the original function. We can sometimes use the same process for functions of more than one variable. For example, suppose that a function <m>f</m> satisfies <m>f_x(x,y) = \cos(y)e^x+2x+y^2</m>,  <m>f_y(x,y) = -\sin(y)e^x+2xy+3</m>, and <m>f(0,0) = 5</m>.

                <p>
                  Since <m>f_x(x,y)</m> was obtained by taking the derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> like a constant, we reverse the process by integrating <m>f_x(x,y)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> like a constant. We get
                  <me>

                  where <m>g(y)</m> is any function of <m>y</m> and <m>c, k</m> are constants. Note that for any function <m>g(y)</m> that is a function of <m>y</m> alone, the partial derivative of <m>g(y)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is zero. (In other words, we need to consider the possibility that our original function <m>f</m> contains some terms that are in terms of <m>y</m> only.)
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This time, we integrate <m>f_y(x,y)</m> with respect to <m>y</m> while treating <m>x</m> like a constant. We get

                <p>
                  Now we compare our two results. We need to determine what original function yields both of the partial derivatives given. Note that both expressions above contain <m>e^x \cos(y) + xy^2</m>, so that is a piece of our original function. Additionally, we see the function must contain the term <m>x^2</m> that is only in terms of <m>x</m> and the term <m>3y</m> that is only in terms of <m>y</m>. Combining these results yields
                  <me>

                    5 = f(0, 0) = e^0 \cos(0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + k
                  </me>,
                  so <m>5 = 1 + k</m> and thus <m>k = 4</m>. Hence

                  Since <m>f_x(x,y)</m> was obtained by taking the derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> like a constant, we reverse the process by integrating <m>f_x(x,y)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> like a constant. We get
                  <me>
                    \cos(y)e^x + x^2 + xy^2 + c g(y) + k
                  </me>,
                  where <m>g(y)</m> is any function of <m>y</m> and <m>c, k</m> are constants. Note that for any function <m>g(y)</m> that is a function of <m>y</m> alone, the partial derivative of <m>g(y)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is zero. (In other words, we need to consider the possibility that our original function <m>f</m> contains some terms that are in terms of <m>y</m> only.)
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This time, we integrate <m>f_y(x,y)</m> with respect to <m>y</m> while treating <m>x</m> like a constant. We get
                  <me>
                    e^x \cos(y) + xy^2+ 3y + m h(x) + n
                  </me>,
                  where <m>h(x)</m> is any function of <m>x</m> and <m>m, n</m> are constants.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now we compare our two results. We need to determine what original function yields both of the partial derivatives given. Note that both expressions above contain <m>e^x \cos(y) + xy^2</m>, so that is a piece of our original function. Additionally, we see the function must contain the term <m>x^2</m> that is only in terms of <m>x</m> and the term <m>3y</m> that is only in terms of <m>y</m>. Combining these results yields
                  <me>
                    f(x, y) = e^x \cos(y) + x^2 + xy^2 + 3y + k
                  </me>,
                  where <m>k</m> is a constant.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Using the additional information that <m>f(0,0) = 5</m>, we have 
                  <me>
                    5 = f(0, 0) = e^0 \cos(0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + k
                  </me>,
                  so <m>5 = 1 + k</m> and thus <m>k = 4</m>. Hence 
                  <me>
                    f(x, y) = e^x \cos(y) + x^2 + xy^2 + 3y + 4
                  </me>.
                </p>
