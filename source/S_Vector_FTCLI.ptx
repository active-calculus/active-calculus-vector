          Earlier in the chapter, we've used <xref
          ref="Clairaut" text="title" /> to argue that a
          vector field in <m>\R^2</m> is not a gradient vector field
          when <m>\partial F_1/\partial y\neq \partial F_2/\partial
          x</m>. Earlier in this preview activity, you verified that a
          given vector field was the gradient of a particular function
          of two variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of
          three variables. However, in that case there are six mixed
          partials to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious.The
          remaining parts of this preview activity suggest a process
          for determining if a vector field in <m>\R^3</m> is a
          gradient vector field as well as finding a potential
          function for the vector field.

<subsection>
  <title>Path-Independent Vector Fields</title>
  <p>
    We say that a vector field <m>\vF</m> defined on a domain <m>D</m>
    is <term><em>path-independent</em></term>
    <idx><h>pathindependent</h><h>definition</h></idx> if
    <m>\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> whenever
    <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented paths in <m>D</m> such that
    both curves start at the same point <m>P</m> and end at point
    <m>Q</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="act_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals_DifferentPaths" /> and
    <xref ref="ex_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals_ParamIndep" />, we
    encountered situations where we had evidence that a vector field
    was path-independent. However, since the definition of
    path-independence requires that the value of the line integral be
    the same for <em>every</em> pair of points in the domain and
    <em>every</em> possible path from one point to the other, it
    doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent
    is an easy task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be shown to be path-independent. Let <m>f\colon \R^3\to \R</m> be a function for which <m>\nabla f</m> is continuous on a domain <m>D</m>. Suppose that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are points in <m>D</m> and let <m>C</m> be a smooth oriented path from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>. Let's take a look at <m>\int_C\nabla f \cdot d\vr</m> by fixing an arbitrary parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m> of <m>C</m>, <m>a\leq t \leq b</m>. Since <m>\nabla f(\vr(t)) = \langle f_x(\vr(t)),f_y(\vr(t)),f_z(\vr(t))\rangle</m>, we know that
    <me>
      \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr  = \int_a^b \nabla f(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)\, dt = \int_a^b \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)), f_z(\vr(t))\rangle \cdot \vr'(t)\, dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t)\rangle</m>, then the integrand above is
    <me>
      \langle f_x(\vr(t)), f_y(\vr(t)), f_z(\vr(t))\rangle\cdot \langle x'(t),y'(t),z'(t)\rangle =\\ 
      f_x\left( x(t),y(t),z(t) \right) x'(t) + f_y \left( x(t),y(t),z(t) \right) y'(t) + f_z \left( x(t),y(t),z(t) \right) z'(t).
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that this is exactly what the <xref
    ref="S-10-5-Chain-Rule" text="custom">chain rule</xref> tells us <m>\frac{d}{dt} f(\vr(t))</m> is equal to.
    Therefore,
    <me>
      \int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vr = \int_a^b \frac{d}{dt} f(\vr(t))\, dt = f(\vr(b)) - f(\vr(a)) = f(Q) - f(P)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, gradient vector fields are path-independent vector fields, and we can evaluate line integrals of gradient vector fields by using a potential function. (Technically the argument above assumed that <m>C</m> was smooth, but we can replace <m>C</m> by a piecewise smooth curve by splitting the line integral up into the sum of finitely many line integrals along smooth curves.)
  </p>
  <p>
    This result is so important that it is frequently called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, because of its similarity to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which can be written as
    <me>
      \int_a^b f'(x)\, dx = f(b) - f(a)

  <title>Line Integrals Along Closed Curves</title>
  <p>
    Recall that we call an oriented curve <m>C</m> <em>closed</em> if it has the same initial and terminal point. A typical example of a closed curve would be a circle (with an orientation of which way to go around), but we could also consider something like the square with vertices <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(-1,1)</m>, <m>(-1,-1)</m>, and <m>(1,-1)</m>, oriented clockwise (or counterclockwise). Recall that we sometimes use the symbol <m>\oint</m> for a line integral when the curve is closed and that if <m>C=C_1+C_2</m>, then <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr=\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr+ \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>.

    useful way to show that a vector field is path-independent, it can
    be a useful way to show that a vector field is <em>not</em>
    path-independent: find a closed curve around which the circulation
    is not zero.

      <p>In <m>\vF</m>, we consider the square with lower-left corner

      clockwise, to be <m>C</m>. Notice that <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr >
    0</m> because the line integrals along the horizontal edges of the
      square are both positive and the line integrals along the
      vertical sides are zero because <m>\vF</m> is orthogonal to
      those sides. Because the line integral along this closed curve
      is not <m>0</m>, <m>\vF</m> is not path-independent.</p>

      <p> In <m>\vG</m>, consider the circle <m>C</m> of radius

      <m>\vG</m> is tangent to <m>C</m>, but we can confidently say
      that <m>\vG\cdot d\vr > 0</m> along <m>C</m>, which makes

    Recall that in single variable calculus, the Second Fundamental

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle</m> be a continuous,
        path-independent vector field on an open, connected region
        <m>D</m>. We will assume that <m>D</m> is in <m>\R^2</m> and
        <m>\vF</m> is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas
        below generalize completely to <m>\R^3</m>. We want to define
        a function <m>f</m> on <m>D</m> by using the vector field
        <m>\vF</m> and line integrals, much like the Second
        Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an
        antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite
        integral. To that end, we assign <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> an
        arbitrary value. (Setting <m>f(x_0,y_0)=0</m> is probably
        convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume
        that <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> is defined to be some number.) Now for
        any other point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>D</m>, define
        <me>
          f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr
        </me>,
        where <m>C</m> is any oriented path from <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m>. Since <m>D</m> is connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since <m>\vF</m> is
        path-independent, <m>f</m> is well-defined. If different paths from <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m> gave different values for the line integral, then we'd not be sure what <m>f(x,y)</m> really is.
