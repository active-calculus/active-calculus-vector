            Given a function <m>f</m> of two independent
            variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, how are the second-order
            partial derivatives of <m>f</m> defined?
          </p>
        </li> 
        <li>
          <p>
          What do the second-order
          partial derivatives <m>f_{xx}</m>, <m>f_{yy}</m>, <m>f_{xy}</m>, and <m>f_{yx}</m>
          of a function <m>f</m> tell us about the function's behavior?

    <introduction>

    <p>
      Recall that for a single-variable function <m>f</m>, the second derivative of <m>f</m> is defined to be the derivative of the first derivative. That is, <m>f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[f'(x)]</m>, which can be stated in terms of the limit definition of the derivative by writing
      <me>
        f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In what follows, we begin exploring the four different second-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables and seek to understand what these various derivatives tell us about the function's behavior.

          Once again, let's consider the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = \frac{x^2\sin(2y)}{32}</m> that measures a projectile's range as a function of its initial speed <m>x</m> and launch angle <m>y</m>. The graph of this function, including traces with <m>x=150</m> and <m>y=0.6</m>, is shown in <xref ref="F_10_3_preview">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> has two first order partial derivatives, <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m>. As we saw in Preview <xref ref="PA_10_3">Activity</xref>, each of these first-order partial derivatives has two partial derivatives, giving a total of four <em>second-order</em> partial derivatives<idx><h>partial derivatives</h><h>second-order</h></idx>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>

              \left(\frac{\partial

              \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}</m>,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f_{yy} = (f_y)_y=\frac{\partial}{\partial y} 
              \left(\frac{\partial
                f}{\partial y}\right) = 
              \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}</m>,
          </p>

        <li>

              \left(\frac{\partial
                f}{\partial x}\right) = 
              \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}</m>,

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first two are called <em>unmixed</em> second-order partial
      derivatives<idx><h>partial derivatives</h><h>second-order, unmixed</h></idx> while the
      last two are called the <em>mixed</em> second-order partial
      derivatives<idx><h>partial derivatives</h><h>second-order, mixed</h></idx>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One aspect of this notation can be a little confusing. The notation
      <me>
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial
          y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)
      </me>
      means that we first differentiate with respect to <m>x</m> and then with
      respect to <m>y</m>; this can be expressed in the alternate notation <m>f_{xy} = (f_x)_y</m>. However, to find the second partial derivative
      <me>
        f_{yx} = (f_y)_x
      </me>
      we first differentiate with respect to <m>y</m> and then <m>x</m>. This means
      that
      <me>
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = f_{xy}, 
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y} = f_{yx}.
      </me>
    </p>

      Be sure to note carefully the difference between Leibniz notation and subscript notation and the order in which <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> appear in each. In addition, remember that anytime we compute a partial derivative, we hold constant the variable(s) other than the one we are differentiating with respect to.

    <title>Interpreting the Second-Order Partial Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      Recall from single variable calculus that the second derivative
      measures the instantaneous rate of change of the derivative. This observation is
      the key to understanding the meaning of the second-order partial
      derivatives.

    <p>
      Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a
      point provides us with information about the concavity of the function
      at that point. Since the unmixed second-order partial derivative
      <m>f_{xx}</m> requires us to hold <m>y</m> constant and differentiate twice with
      respect to <m>x</m>, we may simply view <m>f_{xx}</m> as the second derivative
      of a trace of <m>f</m> where <m>y</m> is fixed. As such, <m>f_{xx}</m> will measure
      the concavity of this trace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider, for example, <m>f(x,y) = \sin(x) e^{-y}</m>. <xref ref="F_10_3_fxx">Figure</xref> shows the graph of this function along with the
      trace given by <m>y=-1.5</m>. Also shown are three tangent lines to this
      trace, with increasing <m>x</m>-values from left to right among the three plots in <xref ref="F_10_3_fxx">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as <m>x</m> increases is
      reflected, as it is in one-variable calculus, in the fact that the
      trace is concave down. Indeed, we see that <m>f_x(x,y)=\cos(x)e^{-y}</m> and so
      <m>f_{xx}(x,y)=-\sin(x)e^{-y} \lt  0</m>, since <m>e^{-y} &gt; 0</m> for all values of <m>y</m>, including <m>y = -1.5</m>.

              The figures seem to indicate that the slopes of the tangent lines to the trace
              <m>f(1.75,y)</m> increase as <m>y</m> increases.
              Note that <m>\frac{d}{dy} f(1.75,y) = \frac{d}{dy} \sin(1.75) e^{-y} = -\sin(1.75) e^{-y}</m>,
              so as <m>y</m> increases the slopes of the tangent lines become less negative.
              Note also that <m>\frac{d^2}{dy^2} f(1.75,y) = \sin(1.75)e^{-y}</m> which is a decreasing function.
              This tells us that the <m>x=1.75</m> trace is concave down.
              That means that the slopes of the tangent lines to the trace are increasing,
              but at a decreasing rate.
              This is reflected in the fact that the surface seems to be leveling off as <m>y</m> increases.

              Based on the figure,
              the slopes of the tangent lines in the <m>x</m> direction along the <m>x=1.75</m> trace appear to be negative,
              but getting less negative as <m>y</m> increases.
              So we expect <m>f_{xy}(1.75,-1.5)</m> to be positive.

              Since <m>f_x(x,y) = \cos(x)e^{-y}</m>,
              we have <m>f_{xy} = -\cos(x)e^{-y}</m>.
              So <m>f_{xy}(1.75,-1.5) \approx 0.8</m>.
              This number is positive, as we discussed in the previous part.

              Geometrically, we could describe

              The sketches are shown below.

              <m>f_y(x,y)</m> increases for fixed <m>y</m>.
              So we should expect <m>f_{yx}(1.75,-1.5)</m> to be positive.
              In fact, <m>f_{yx}(1.75,-1.5) = 0.8</m>.
              The value of <m>f_{yx}(1.75,-1.5)</m> measures how much the surface

      Just as with the first-order partial derivatives, we can
      approximate second-order partial derivatives in the situation where we have only
      partial information about the function.

      As we have found in <xref ref="A_10_3_2a">Activities</xref> and <xref ref="A_10_3_6"/>, we may think of <m>f_{xy}</m> as measuring the
      <q>twist</q> of the graph as we increase <m>y</m> along a particular trace where <m>x</m> is held constant. In the same way, <m>f_{yx}</m> measures how
      the graph twists as we increase <m>x</m>. If we remember that Clairaut's
      theorem tells us that <m>f_{xy} = f_{yx}</m>, we see that the amount of
      twisting is the same in both directions. This twisting is perhaps
      more easily seen in <xref ref="F_10_3_ruled">Figure</xref>, which shows the graph
      of <m>f(x,y) = -xy</m>, for which <m>f_{xy} = -1</m>.

        <p>
          There are four second-order partial derivatives of a function
            <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
          <me>
            f_{xx} = (f_x)_x,
              f_{xy} = (f_x)_y,
              f_{yx} = (f_y)_x,\ \mbox{and}  \ 
              f_{yy} = (f_y)_y.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The unmixed second-order partial derivatives, <m>f_{xx}</m> and
              <m>f_{yy}</m>, tell us about the concavity of the traces. The mixed second-order partial derivatives, <m>f_{xy}</m> and
              <m>f_{yx}</m>, tell us how the graph of <m>f</m> twists.

                The limit definition of <m>I_{TT}(94,75)</m> is

                To estimate  <m>I_{TT}(94,75)</m> we will use the symmetric difference quotient

                To do this we need to approximate

                For <m>I_T(96,75)</m> we can only use a backwards difference quotient,

                  I_T(96,75) \approx \frac{I(96,75)-I(94,75)}{2} = 3.5 \ \text{ and }  \ I_T(92,75) \approx \frac{I(94,75)-I(90,75)}{4} = 3

                </me>.
                The fact that <m>I_{TT}(94,75) \approx 0.125</m> means that for every one
                <m>^{\circ}F</m> increase in temperature from
                <m>94^{\circ}</m>F, the rate at which the heat index changes as the temperature increases grows by approximately 0.125

                For <m>I_H(94,70)</m> we can only use a forward difference quotient,

                The fact that <m>I_{HH}(94,75) \approx 0.02</m> means that for every one % increase in the relative humidity from 75%, the rate at which the heat index changes as the relative humidity increases grows by approximately 0.02

                The fact that <m>I_{HT}(94,75) \approx 0.05</m> means that for every one degree increase in temperature from

                Since <m>f_x(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}y^2</m>, we have
                <me>
                  \frac{ \partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}  = 0
                </me>.
                So <m>f_{xx}(a,b) = 0</m>.
                This calculation tells us that a small increase in the mass of an object from 4 kg does not affect the rate at which the kinetic energy changes as we increase the mass.
                In other words,
                <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(4.1,5)</m> should be approximately the same as <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(4,5)</m>

                So <m>f_{yy}(a,b) = 4</m>.
                This calculation tells us that increasing the velocity of an object by one meter per second from 5 meters per second while keeping the mass constant at 4 kg causes an approximate 4 unit
                (in Joules per meter per second)
                increase in the rate at which the kinetic energy changes as we increase the velocity.
                In other words,
