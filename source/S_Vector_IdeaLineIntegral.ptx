  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we discussed in <xref ref="S_Vector_VectorFields" />, vector fields are often used to represent forces such as gravity or electromagnetism, as well as the velocity of movement for things like wind or flowing water.
      <aside>
        <title>Velocity versus Force</title>
        <p>
          Movement by things like air or water will exert a force on objects, so wind velocity vector fields are related to a force field but the relationship between a moving fluid and the force a fluid exerts on an object in the fuild can be complicated. Specifically, issues like drag/friction and cross sectional area are a critical part of this relationship but are not something that we will focus on in our discussion. In the exploration below, we will look at a simplified version of this situation.
        </p>
      </aside>
      We learned in <xref ref="S-9-3-Dot-Product" /> that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the start of its displacement vector to the end. However, this calculation assumes that the force is constant in the region of movement and that the object moves in a straight line along the displacement vector. The situation is more complicated than a dot product calculation when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preview activity uses cardinal directions to specify the direction of displacement vectors. These directions can be described by a compass rose. The compass rose given in <xref ref="comp_rose" /> is an example of a sixteen point rose. Note that directions like ESE are read as "east-southeast" since ESE is half way between east and southeast.

    <title>Orientations of Curves</title>
    <p>
      Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern ourselves with <em>how</em> the object moves. In particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point <m>(0,1)</m> to the point <m>(4,3)</m> by first going up the <m>y</m>-axis to <m>(0,3)</m> and then moving horizontally to <m>(4,3)</m> (illustrated by <m>C_1</m> in <xref ref="oriented_curves" />) than if the object moves along the line segment from <m>(0,1)</m> directly to <m>(4,3)</m>(illustrated by <m>C_2</m> in <xref ref="oriented_curves" />). Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the object moves from <m>(4,3)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> directly along a line segment (<m>C_3</m> in <xref ref="oriented_curves" />). We say that a curve in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m> is <term>oriented</term> if we have specified the direction of travel along the curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.

      In general, there are many ways to parametrize an oriented curve. With line segments, it is common to have the parameter range from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>, although there are sometimes good reasons to choose another method. For circles and ellipses, you may find it useful to interchange the placement of <m>\cos(t)</m> and <m>\sin(t)</m> to change the orientation, but then careful attention will need to be paid to the start and end points. The interactive graph below allows you to plot parametric curves. You should experiment with the graph below and try to make sense of how different changes affects the graph below. Remember that you can change the highlighted point using the slider. You should take time now to at least try the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Change the upper bound of the plot to <m> 2 \pi</m></li>
        <li>Exchange the sine and cosine functions in <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> (but do not change the coefficents)</li>
        <li>Change the <m>t</m> in each of the component functions to <m>-t</m></li>
        <li>Change the <m>-t</m> to <m>e^t</m> (you will need to use the exp(t) function in Sage)</li>
        <li>Change the upper and lower bounds to get the same curve plotted as in the earlier parts</li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      <xref ref="PA_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral" /> showed how we can break up the work done along a path into a sum of work done on each piece. This will be a very helpful idea, especially if we consider the work done by a vector field that is not constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let's consider who to measure the work done by <m>\vF</m>, a vector field, along <m>C</m>, the curve show below that goes from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_line_int_defn1">

    </figure>
    <p>
      You can see that there will be parts of <m>C</m> such that the dot product of the direction of travel and the vector field will be positive and some parts where the dot product is negative. We don't need to consider the output of the vector field except at the points on the curve. Thus, we will look at the following plot of the output of <m>/vF</m> at a collection of points on the curve <m>C</m>. Remember that when the vector field is plotted on the whole space, the lengths are rescaled to not be visually cluttered. In <xref ref="fig_line_int_defn2" /> the actual output vectors are plotted for some points on <m>C</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_line_int_defn2">

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Since the output of <m>/vF</m> is changing as you move along the path, we will use a classically calculus argument as we did with other integration ideas and break our region up into smaller pieces to approximate the work done on each piece. <xref ref="fig_line_int_defn3" /> below shows how we can break up <m>C</m> into <m>n</m> pieces, which we will call <m>C_i</m>.

      If we look at one of these smaller pieces (as show in <xref ref="fig_line_int_defn4" />), we can see that vector field still changes at these points, but the output vectors are very similar. We can also see that the vector <m>\Delta \mathbf{r}_i= \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_{i-1}</m> is a good approximation of the curve piece <m>C_i</m>. Therefore we can approximate the work done by the vector field <m>\vF</m> on the piece <m>C_i</m> by <m>
      \vF(\mathbf{r}_i^*)\cdot \Delta \mathbf{r}_i </m>, where <m>\mathbf{r}_i^*</m> is a point in <m>C_i</m>.

      As we increase <m>n</m> (the number of pieces of <m>C</m> in our approximation) and make sure the length of each <m>C_i</m> goes to zero, the vector field <m>\vF</m> will be nearly constant on each piece and <m>\Delta \mathbf{r}_i </m> will be a better approximation of <m>C_i</m>. This means that our approximation with <m>n</m> pieces of <m>C</m> would be
      <me> \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vF(\mathbf{r}_i)\cdot \Delta \mathbf{r}_i </me>
      and the exact amount of work done by <m>\vF</m> over <m>C</m> could be calculated by taking the limit of this approximation as the number of pieces increases and the size of each piece goes to zero. This should be a familiar Riemann sum argument from earlier definitions involving integration.

      Just as when we differentiated a vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> to find a tangent vector, we begin by dividing a curve <m>C</m> oriented from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> into <m>n</m> small, straight pieces.

      If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product <m>\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i</m> makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. This is because if the vector <m>\vr_i</m> along the curve and the force field vector <m>\vF(\vr_i)</m> point in similar directions, the dot product will be positive.
        <fn>
          We are abusing notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of <m>\vF</m> is points in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>, and <m>\vr_i</m> is a vector.  By <m>\vF(\vr)</m>, we mean <m>\vF(r_1,r_2)</m>, where <m>\vr= \langle r_1,r_2\rangle</m>.
        </fn>
      On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. Taking the sum over <m>i=0,\dots,n-1</m>, we have a Riemann sum that approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft as it flies along <m>C</m>:
      <me>
        \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vF(\vr_i)\cdot\Delta \vr_i
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This suggests the following definition.
    </p> -->

    <definition xml:id="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>C</m> be an oriented curve and <m>\vF</m> a vector field defined in a region containing <m>C</m>. The

          provided the limit exists.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The limit in <xref ref="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral" /> exists provided that <m>\vF</m> is a continuous vector field, by which we mean that each component function of <m>\vF</m> is continuous as a function of <m>2</m> or <m>3</m> variables, and that <m>C</m> is a piecewise smooth curved traced out from its initial point to its terminal point without retracing any portion of the curve. <term>Piecewise smooth</term> means that the curve can be separated into parts which are individually smooth (can be parameterized with functions that are infinitely differentiable).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> can each be viewed as the work done by <m>\vF</m> as an object moves along the (very small) vector <m>\Delta\vr_i</m>, the line integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object that moves along <m>C</m> (in the direction of its orientation).

      If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product <m>\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i</m> makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. Note here that our vector <m>\Delta\vr_i</m> is the displacement from <m>\vr_{i-1}</m> to <m>\vr_i</m>. If the vector <m>\vr_i</m> and the force field vector <m>\vF(\vr_i)</m> point in directions with an acute angle between them, the dot product will be positive.
        <fn>
          We are abusing notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of <m>\vF</m> is points in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>, and <m>\vr_i</m> is a vector.  By <m>\vF(\vr)</m>, we mean <m>\vF(r_1,r_2)</m>, where <m>\vr= \langle r_1,r_2\rangle</m>.
        </fn>
      On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. This interpretation carries through with our limit argument above. Specifically, the line integral over a curve will be positive if more of the vector field is in the direction of travel than against the direction of travel. You will need to consider the value of the dot product and not just the sign when assessing whether a line integral will be positive/neagtive/zero.

      <title>Alternative notation for line integrals</title>
      <p>
        Our notation for line integrals is one of several common notations. This notation's strength is that it emphasizes the role of a vector field and dot product. Another common notation for the line integral of a vector field <m>\langle P, Q, R\rangle</m> along a curve <m>C</m> is <m>\int_C P\, dx + Q\, dy + R\, dz</m>. This notation is common in physics and engineering. We will limit ourselves to the <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> notation in the body of the text, but some exercises may use alternative notation.

      The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to efficiently calculate line integrals. As with the limits in the definition of every other type of integral we've studied so far, the limit in the definition of the line integral is is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in the case where the oriented curve <m>C</m> is composed of horizontal and vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a single-variable integral, as the following example shows.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_HorizVert">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the constant vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle 2,1\rangle</m>. Let <m>C</m> be the curve that follows the horizontal line segment from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(4,1)</m> and then continues down the vertical line segment to <m>(4,-2)</m>.  <xref ref="fig_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_ConstantField" /> shows <m>\vF</m> and <m>C</m>, including the orientation.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To calculate <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, we start by working
          with the horizontal line segment.  Along that part of
          <m>C</m>, notice that <m>d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta
          x\vi</m>.  Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line
          integral along this portion of <m>C</m> consists of terms of
          the form <m>\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
          x</m>.  Along this part of <m>C</m>, <m>x</m> ranges from
          <m>1</m> to <m>4</m>, and thus we can turn the Riemann sum
          here into the definite integral <m>\int_1^4 2\, dx = 6</m>.
          Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that
          agrees with the orientation of <m>C</m>, we are not
          surprised to have a positive value here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of
          <m>C</m>.  Here <m>d\vr \approx \Delta\vr = \Delta y\vj</m>,
          which means that <m>\vF\cdot d\vr\approx 1\Delta y</m>.
          Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite
          integral <m>\int_1^{-2} 1\, dy = -3</m>.  Notice that the
          limits of integration here were set up to match the
          orientation of <m>C</m>.  Also, the negative value should
          not be unexpected, since <m>C</m> is oriented in a direction
          for which the vectors of <m>\vF</m> point in a direction
          that would hinder motion along <m>C</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Combining these two calculations, we find that <m>\int_C
          \vF\cdot d\vr = 6 - 3 = 3</m>.

      In <xref ref="ex_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_HorizVert"/>, we implicitly made use of the idea that if <m>C</m> can be broken up into two curves <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> such that the terminal point of <m>C_1</m> is the initial point of <m>C_2</m>, then the line integral of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C</m> is the sum of the line integrals of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C_1</m> and along <m>C_2</m>. Recalling the property for definite integrals that tells us if <m>c\ in [a,b]</m>, then 
      <me>
        \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = \int_a^c f(x)\, dx + \int_c^b f(x)\, dx

      This ability to break line integrals into pieces (described below) is probably not surprising.

If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m> from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>, we denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m> that follows <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.  Also, if <m>C_1</m> is an oriented curve, <m>-C_1</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analog amongst the properties of definite integrals.

            A vector field in the first quadrant with <m>x,y\leq 5</m>. Vectors are parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis and point in the negative <m>y</m>-direction. Vectors get longer as distance from the <m>y</m>-axis increases. There are six labeled oriented curves. The curve <m>C_1</m> is the line segment from <m>(3,3)</m> to <m>(4,3)</m>. The curve <m>C_2</m> is the line segment from <m>(4,3)</m> to <m>(4,5)</m>. The curve <m>C_3</m> is the line segment from <m>(4,5)</m> to <m>(3,5)</m>. The curve <m>C_4</m> is the line segment from <m>(3,5)</m> to <m>(3,3)</m>. The curve <m>C_5</m> is the lower half of the circle of radius <m>1</m> centered at <m>(3,2)</m> oriented counterclockwise.

          <p>The portion of the vector field that produces acute angles with <m>C_5</m> has smaller magnitude and smaller length than the portion that produces obtuse angles. Thus, the line integral must be negative.</p>

          <p>
            Notice that <m>\vF</m> is orthogonal to <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_3</m>. Thus, <m>\displaystyle\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr = 0</m>. Where the magnitude of the vectors in <m>\vF</m> is larger, <m>\vF</m> points in the opposite direction as the orientation of <m>C</m>. Thus, <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> is negative.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Notice that <m>\displaystyle\int_{C_4}\vF\cdot d\vr</m> is the only one of the six line integrals that is positive, so it is the largest. Since <m>\vF</m> is orthogonal to <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_3</m>, <m>\displaystyle\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr = 0</m>. Note that while <m>C_6</m> is twice as long as <m>C_2</m>, the vectors in the vector field that are hindering <m>C_2</m> are more than twice as long as those hindering <m>C_6</m> Thus, <m>\displaystyle\int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr \lt \displaystyle\int_{C_6}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. We do not yet have all the tools necessary to calculate the exact value of <m>\displaystyle\int_{C_5}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. However, it is greater than <m>\displaystyle\int_{C_6}\vF\cdot d\vr</m>. Thus, the ordering is <me>\int_{C_4}\vF\cdot d\vr > \int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr = \int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr > \int_{C_5}\vF\cdot d\vr > \int_{C_6}\vF\cdot d\vr > \int_{C_2}\vF\cdot d\vr</me>.

        <p>Circular curve has positive circulation. Larger rectangular

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The circular curve is oriented consistently with the vector
          field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The larger
          rectangular curve is either orthogonal to the vector field
          or oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the
          circulation is positive. The smaller rectangular curve is
          orthogonal to the vector field or has the opposite
          orientation. Thus, its circulation is negative.

    <title>Summary</title>

    <ul>
      <li>
         <p>
          An oriented curve can be represented by a vector-valued function of one variable <m>\vr(t)</m> where we interpret the initial and terminal values of the domain of <m>\vr</m> as giving an orientation to the curve. A curve that ends at the same point where it started is said to be closed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A line integral (of a vector field) measures the extent to which the vector field points in a direction consistent with the orientation of the curve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Line integrals have many properties that are analogous to those of definite integrals of functions of a single
          variable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation of the vector field along the curve.
