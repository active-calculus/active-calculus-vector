  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we discussed in <xref ref="S_Vector_VectorFields" />, vector
      fields are often useful as representations of forces such as
      gravity, wind, and flowing water.  We learned in <xref
      ref="S-9-3-Dot-Product" /> that the dot
      product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how
      much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail
      of its displacement vector to the tip.  However, things get more
      complicated when an object's movement is not in a straight line
      and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which
      the object moves.  For example, how much work is done by a wind
      of <quantity><mag>30</mag><unit base="mile" /><per base="hour"
      /></quantity> toward the northwest on an airplane that's flying
      <quantity><mag>500</mag><unit base="mile" /></quantity> due
      north?  What if the wind gets weaker the farther north the plane
      gets?  In this section, we begin investigating how integration
      can be used to calculate the work a force field does in such
      circumstances.

  <subsection xml:id="SS_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_OrientCurve">
    <title>Orientations of Curves</title>
    <p>
      Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field
      does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural
      to concern ourselves with <em>how</em> the object moves.  In
      particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an
      object moves from the point <m>(0,1)</m> to the point
      <m>(4,3)</m> by first going up the <m>y</m>-axis to <m>(0,3)</m>
      and then moving horizontally to <m>(4,3)</m> than if the object
      moves along the line segment from <m>(0,1)</m> directly to
      <m>(4,3)</m>.  Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would
      expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the
      object moves from <m>(4,3)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> directly along a
      line segment.  We say that a curve in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>
      is <term>oriented</term> if we have specified the direction of
      travel along the curve.  When a curve is given parametrically
      (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be
      that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value
      of the parameter to the largest.

    <p>Notice that there are, in general, many ways to parametrize an
    oriented curve. With line segments, it is common to have the
    parameter range from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>, although there are
    sometimes good reasons to choose another method. For circles and
    ellipses, you may find it useful to interchange the placement of
    <m>\cos(t)</m> and <m>\sin(t)</m> to change the orientation, but
    then careful attention may need to be paid to the start and end
    points. The interactive graphing applet below allows you to plot
    parametric curves. Click the <q>Animate</q> button to trace out
    the curve from your lower value of <m>t</m> to your upper value of
    <m>t</m>. (Type enter/return on your keyboard to update the graph

      Just as when we differentiated a vector-valued function
      <m>\vr(t)</m> to find a tangent vector, we begin by dividing a
      curve <m>C</m> oriented from a point <m>P</m> to a point
      <m>Q</m> into <m>n</m> small, straight pieces.  Each of these
      pieces is in an area where the vector field <m>\vF</m> is nearly
      constant, provided we use enough pieces.  In <xref
      ref="fig_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_CurveVectors" />, we show this
      situation.  Each <m>\vr_i</m> is the tip of a vector that traces
      out the curve, which makes the vectors <m>\Delta\vr_i =
      \vr_{i+1}-\vr_i</m> (shown in blue) approximate the curve
      <m>C</m>.  The green vectors are the vectors in the vector field
      <m>\vF</m> at each of the designated points along the curve.

    <p>
      If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or
      hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve,
      then calculating the dot product <m>\vF(\vr_i)\cdot
      \Delta\vr_i</m> makes sense for the local amount of help or
      hindrance. This is because if the vector <m>\vr_i</m> along the
      curve and the force field vector <m>\vF(\vr_i)</m> point in
      similar directions, the dot product will be positive.<fn> We are
      abusing notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain
      of <m>\vF</m> is points in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>, and
      <m>\vr_i</m> is a vector.  By <m>\vF(\vr)</m>, we mean
      <m>\vF(r_1,r_2)</m>, where <m>\vr= \langle r_1,r_2\rangle</m>.
      </fn> On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse,
      the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the
      force field is hindering the aircraft's progress.  Taking the
      sum over <m>i=0,\dots,n-1</m>, we have a Riemann sum that
      approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft
      as it flies along <m>C</m>:

      for the line integral of a vector field <m>\langle P, Q,
      R\rangle</m> along a curve <m>C</m> is <m>\int_C P\, dx + Q\, dy
    + R\, dz</m>. This notation is common in physics and
      engineering. We will limit ourselves to the <m>\int_C\vF\cdot
      d\vr</m> notation in the body of the text, but some exercises
      may use alternative notation.</p>

    <p>
      The limit in <xref
      ref="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral" /> exists
      provided that <m>\vF</m> is a continuous vector field, by which
      we mean that each component function of <m>\vF</m> is continuous
      as a function of <m>2</m> or <m>3</m> variables, and that
      <m>C</m> is a piecewise smooth curved traced out from its
      initial point to its terminal point without retracing any
      portion of the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral
      <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> can each be viewed as the work done
      by <m>\vF</m> as an object moves along the (very small) vector
      <m>\Delta\vr_i</m>, the line integral gives the total work done
      by the vector field on an object that moves along <m>C</m> (in
      the direction of its orientation).

    <p>
      The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to
      calculate line integrals. As with the limits in the definition
      of every other type of integral we've studied so far, the limit
      in the definition of the line integral is is cumbersome to work
      with in most cases.  However, in the case where the oriented
      curve <m>C</m> is composed of horizontal and vertical line
      segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a
      single-variable integral, as the following example shows.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_HorizVert">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the constant vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle
          2,1\rangle</m>.  Let <m>C</m> be the curve that follows the
          horizontal line segment from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(4,1)</m>
          and then continues down the vertical line segment to
          <m>(4,-2)</m>.  <xref

          <m>\vF</m> and <m>C</m>, including the
          orientation. Calculate <m>\displaystyle\int_C\vF\cdot

      <solution>
        <p>
          To calculate <m>\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m>, we start by working
          with the horizontal line segment.  Along that part of
          <m>C</m>, notice that <m>d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta
          x\vi</m>.  Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line
          integral along this portion of <m>C</m> consists of terms of
          the form <m>\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
          x</m>.  Along this part of <m>C</m>, <m>x</m> ranges from
          <m>1</m> to <m>4</m>, and thus we can turn the Riemann sum
          here into the definite integral <m>\int_1^4 2\, dx = 6</m>.
          Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that
          agrees with the orientation of <m>C</m>, we are not
          surprised to have a positive value here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of
          <m>C</m>.  Here <m>d\vr \approx \Delta\vr = \Delta y\vj</m>,
          which means that <m>\vF\cdot d\vr\approx 1\Delta y</m>.
          Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite
          integral <m>\int_1^{-2} 1\, dy = -3</m>.  Notice that the
          limits of integration here were set up to match the
          orientation of <m>C</m>.  Also, the negative value should
          not be unexpected, since <m>C</m> is oriented in a direction
          for which the vectors of <m>\vF</m> point in a direction
          that would hinder motion along <m>C</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Combining these two calculations, we find that <m>\int_C
          \vF\cdot d\vr = 6 - 3 = 3</m>.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_HorizVert"/>, we
      implicitly made use of the idea that if <m>C</m> can be broken
      up into two curves <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> such that the
      terminal point of <m>C_1</m> is the initial point of <m>C_2</m>,
      then the line integral of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C</m> is the sum
      of the line integrals of <m>\vF</m> along <m>C_1</m> and along
      <m>C_2</m>.  Recalling the property for definite integrals that
      tells us
      <me>
        \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = \int_a^c f(x)\, dx + \int_c^b f(x)\, dx
      </me>, the ability to work with line integrals in this way is
      probably not surprising.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before stating some useful properties of line integrals, we will
      establish some convenient notation. If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>
      are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m> from a point <m>P</m> to a
      point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>,
      we denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to
      <m>R</m> that follows <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues
      along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.  Also, if <m>C</m> is an oriented
      curve, <m>-C</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite
      orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of
      line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst
      the properties of definite integrals.

      <answer>
        <p>Circular curve has positive circulation. Larger rectangular
        curve has positive circulation. Smaller rectangular curve has
        negative circulation.
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The circular curve is oriented consistently with the vector
          field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The larger
          rectangular curve is either orthogonal to the vector field
          or oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the
          circulation is positive. The smaller rectangular curve is
          orthogonal to the vector field or has the opposite
          orientation. Thus, its circulation is negative.

	<p>An oriented curve is a vector-valued function of one
	variable <m>\vr(t)</m> where we interpret the initial and
	terminal values of the domain of <m>\vr</m> as giving an
	orientation to the curve. A curve that ends at the same point
	where it started is said to be closed.

          A line integral measures of a vector field along an oriented
          curve measures the extent to which the vector field points
          in a direction consistent with the orientation of the curve.

          Line integrals have many properties that are analogous to
          those of definite integrals of functions of a single
          variable. The line integral of a vector field along a closed
	  curve is called the circulation of the vector field along
	  the curve.
