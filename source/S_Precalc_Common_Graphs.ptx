      We have seen how the distance formula leads to the equation of a sphere and how the idea of flat one and two dimensional graphs gave rise to lines and planes. In this section, we will introduce some other curves and surfaces that will be used throughout the rest of this text as examples. These objects will allow us to have graphs with a variety of geometric features while still being algebraically simple.

  <subsection>
    <title>Conic Sections</title>
    <p>
      Go over conic section forms (either put a reference to a full presentation of conics or make an appendix with activities to go through these details)

      Conic sections are graphs of the form <m>Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0</m> and can also be seen as the intersection of a plane and a cone. Applications and uses in optics, engineering

      We will look at the three basic shapes then see how common transformations work on the graphs and equations for those graphs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk about Ellipse first. Show base equation x^2+y^2=1. Go over how ellipse is transformed version of this? Talk about center, horizontal stretch, vertical stretch. In appendix, talk about sum of distances to foci as being constant. Reflective properties that focus reflect to other focus. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyperbola. Start with x^2-y^2=1. Show vertices, center, asypmtotes. Talk about switching the roles of x and y. Show horizontal and vertical stretches take care of everything. Talk aobut shape and how you do not have two parabolas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parabola. Talk about features of y=x^2. Direction of parabola given by linear term. 
    </p>
    <p>
      translation of coordinates. Activity: What value of x' will compute to x=0? y' to y=0?
      Rotation in appendix?
    </p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Cylinder Surfaces</title>
      <p>
        what does x^2+y^2=1 look like in 2D? 3D? Cylinder surfaces are generated by a curve (called the generating curve) and extend along rulings. x^2+y^2=1 has a circle generating curve in xy-plane and rulings extend in z-direction. Only the xy values make a point satisfy (or not satisfy) the defining equation. No choice of z has an effect.
      </p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="quadric-surfaces">
      <title>Quadric Surfaces</title>
      <p>
        activity about understanding the plot of x^2/4+y^2/9-z^2=1. Find intercepts, traces on xy, xz, and yz planes. Intersections with z=1, z=-2, z=sqrt{3}, x=3,x=0. Show several plots. Which one of these plots has the features you state as answers above.

        Do the same with x^2/4-y^2/9-z^2=1
      </p>
      <p>
        go over the other quadric surfaces. 
      </p>
      <p>
        will go over this more later but only a few of these grapsh can be expressed with one coordinate a function of the others. Talk about what this means briefly and then reference the later work.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs.  The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\R^3</m>, the distance between points <m>P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> and <m>Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)</m> (denoted as <m>|PQ|</m>)  is given by the formula
          <me>
            |PQ| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.
          </me>
          and thus the equation of a sphere with center <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and radius <m>r</m> is
          <me>
            (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A trace of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>z = f(c,y)</m> or <m>z = f(x,c)</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A level curve of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>k = f(x,y)</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

          the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the

          (called the principal), the duration <m>t</m> of the loan in years, and
          the interest rate <m>r</m>. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment <m>M</m> that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula
          <me>

                  We cannot have a negative value under the square root. Therefore <m>4 - \left( x^{2} + y^{2} \right) \geq 0</m>, so <m>x^{2} + y^{2} \leq 4</m>.

                  The maximum value of the square root is equal to 2 when <m>x=0, y=0</m>. The minimum value of the square root is 0. Subtract these values from 8 to a range of <m>6 \leq h(x,y) \leq 8</m>.
