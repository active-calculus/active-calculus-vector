  <subsection>
    <title>Three Dimensional Space and Coordinates</title>
   
    <p>
      need to show how coordinates are measured. What a RHS and LHS is. Why this matters. Go over xy-plane, yz-plane, a few fundamental planes. Build the distance formula.  Drawing tips
      Address that other disciplines will use z forward/back, x left/right, and y up/down
    </p>
  <p>
    To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes <mdash/> the      <m>x</m>-axis, the <m>y</m>-axis, and the <m>z</m>-axis (called the <em>coordinate axes</em>). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a 3D coordinate system, as shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>; thus, before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.
  </p>


    <figure xml:id="F-9-1-left-right-hand">
      <caption>Left: A left hand system. Right: A right hand system</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
        <image source="images/fig_9_1_left_hand"/>
        <image source="images/fig_9_1_right_hand"/>
        </sidebyside>
    </figure>
    

    <p>
      The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In the coordinate system shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>, imagine that you are sitting on the positive <m>z</m>-axis next to the label <q><m>z</m>.</q> Looking down at the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes, you see that the <m>y</m>-axis is obtained by rotating the <m>x</m>-axis by 90<m>^\circ</m> in the <em>clockwise</em> direction. Again sitting on the positive <m>z</m>-axis in the coordinate system at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>, you see that the <m>y</m>-axis is obtained by rotating the <m>x</m>-axis by 90<m>^\circ</m> in the <em>counterclockwise</em>
      direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We call the coordinate system at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand"/> a <em>right-hand system</em>; if we point the index finger of our <em>right</em>
      hand along the positive <m>x</m>-axis and our middle finger along the
      positive <m>y</m>-axis, then our thumb points in the direction of the
      positive <m>z</m>-axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to
      use a right-hand system throughout this book.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Notation:</em> We let <m>\R^2</m> denote the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers in the plane (two copies of the real number system) and let <m>\R^3</m> represent the set of all ordered triples of real numbers (which constitutes three-space).
    </p>

    <title>Some Standard Equations in Three-Space</title>
    <p>
      In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand
      graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in
      <m>\R^2</m>, the graphs of the equations <m>x=a</m> and <m>y=b</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
      are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. In the next
      activity we consider their three-dimensional analogs.

      <xref ref="A-9-1-3">Activity</xref> shows that the equations where one independent
      variable is constant lead to planes parallel to ones that result from
      a pair of the coordinate axes. When we make the constant 0, we get the
      <em>coordinate planes</em><idx><h>coordinate planes</h></idx>. The <m>xy</m>-plane
      satisfies <m>z=0</m>, the <m>xz</m>-plane satisfies <m>y=0</m>, and the <m>yz</m>-plane

      On a related note, we define a circle in <m>\R^2</m> as the set of all
      points equidistant from a fixed point. In <m>\R^3</m>, we call the set of
      all points equidistant from a fixed point a
      <em>sphere</em><idx><h>sphere</h><h>definition</h></idx>. To find the equation of a
      sphere, we need to understand how to calculate the distance between
      two points in three-space, and we explore this idea in the next

      Equation <xref ref="eq-9-1-Distance-3D"/> can be used to derive the formula
      for a sphere<idx><h>sphere</h><h>formula</h></idx> centered at a point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>
      with radius <m>r</m>. Since the distance from any point <m>(x,y,z)</m> on such a

      Squaring both sides, we come to the standard equation for a sphere.

      When we study functions of several variables we are often interested
      in how each individual variable affects the function in and of
      itself. In <xref ref="PA-9-1">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the amount initially invested and the
      duration of the investment. However, if we fix the initial investment, the
      amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the initial investment. This idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of several variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      As another example, consider again the distance function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}
      </me>
      where <m>x</m> is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, <m>y</m> is the launch angle in radians, and <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at <m>y=0.6</m> radians, we can consider <m>f</m> a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{x^2}{32}\sin(2\cdot 0.6).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the
      surface when <m>y = 0.6</m>, as shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula clearly shows that <m>f</m> is quadratic in the <m>x</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we
      can consider the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this

      We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when <m>x=150</m>, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula clearly show that <m>f</m> is sinusoidal in the <m>y</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity constant, the horizontal distance traveled by the object is proportional to the sine of twice the launch
      angle.

    <title>Contour Maps and Level Curves</title>
    <p>
      We have all seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine
      Mountains in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-porcupine">Figure</xref>.<fn>Map source: Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with permission of the Michigan DNR and Bob Wild.</fn> The curves on these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in elevation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if <m>f(x,y)</m> represents the altitude at the point <m>(x,y)</m>, then each contour is the graph of an equation of the form <m>f(x,y) = k</m>, for some constant <m>k</m>.

      The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves
      in space. In order to understand these traces and level curves better,
      we will first spend some time learning about vectors and vector-valued
      functions in the next few sections and return to our study of
      functions of several variables once we have those more mathematical
      tools to support their study.

      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs.  The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\R^3</m>, the distance between points <m>P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> and <m>Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)</m> (denoted as <m>|PQ|</m>)  is given by the formula
          <me>
            |PQ| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.
          </me>
          and thus the equation of a sphere with center <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and radius <m>r</m> is
          <me>
            (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A trace of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>z = f(c,y)</m> or <m>z = f(x,c)</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A level curve of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>k = f(x,y)</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

          When people buy a large ticket item like a
          car or a house, they often take out a loan to make the purchase. The
          loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of
          the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the
          borrower has to make depends on the amount <m>P</m> of money borrowed
          (called the principal), the duration <m>t</m> of the loan in years, and
          the interest rate <m>r</m>. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment <m>M</m> that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula
          <me>
            M(r,t) = \frac{1500r}{1-\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}}.

                  The maximum value of the square root is equal to 2 when <m>x=0, y=0</m>. The minimum value of the square root is 0. Subtract these values from 8 to a range of <m>6 \leq h(x,y) \leq 8</m>.

                  Subtract 8 from both sides to get <m>h - 8 = - \sqrt{4 - x^2 - y^2}</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Divide by -1 to get <m>8 - h = \sqrt{4 - x^2 - y^2}</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Square both side to get <m>(8-h)^2 = 4 -x^2 -y^2</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4 - (8-h)^2</m>.

                  It follow from part d that if <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4 - (8-h)^2</m>, then <m>x^2 = 4 - (8-h)^2 - y^2</m> and <m>x = - \sqrt{4 - (8-h)^2 - x^2}</m>. Then choose y values to graph the traces.
