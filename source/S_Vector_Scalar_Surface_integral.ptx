  <introduction>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt"/>, the idea of a flux integral was introduced by looking at how much of a vector field flows through a given section of a surface in space. In particular, the flux integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is orthogonal to the surface (which changes at different points on the surface.) <xref ref="thm_flux_int_calc"/> shows the best way to calculate the flux integral in terms of a parameterization of the surface. This was an extension of the method for computing the surface area given in <xref ref="S-11-6-Parametric-Surfaces-Surface-Area"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as we generalized line integrals of vector fields into scalar line integrals in <xref ref="S_ScalarLineIntegral"/>, we will spend this section looking at the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        How could we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a surface in space?
      </li>
      <li>
        What would that accmulation measure?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the most efficient way to calculate this?

  <subsection>
  <title>Defining surface integrals of scalar functions</title>  
  <p>
    In order to create a Riemann sum that will measure the acculumation of <m>f(x,y,z)</m>, a scalar valued function, over <m>S_1</m>. a bounded smooth surface in space, we will break our surface into smaller piecese where we can approximate the output of <m>f</m> and the surface area of each piece. In <xref ref="SS-11-6-2-Surface-Area-Parametrically-Defined-Surfaces"/> and <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt"/>, we developed the way to measure surface area given a parameterization for the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that <m>S_1</m> is parametrized by <m>\vr(s,t)</m> with <m>a\leq s\leq b</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m>. In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice <m>a\leq s\leq b</m> into <m>n</m> equally-sized subintervals with endpoints <m>s_1,\ldots,s_n</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m> into <m>m</m> equally-sized subintervals with endpoints <m>t_1,\ldots,t_m</m>. This divides <m>D</m> into <m>nm</m>
    rectangles of size <m>\Delta{s}=\frac{b-a}{n}</m> by <m>\Delta{t}=\frac{d-c}{m}</m>. We index these rectangles as <m>D_{i,j}</m>. Every <m>D_{i,j}</m> has area (in the <m>st</m>-plane) of <m>\Delta{s}\Delta{t}</m>. The partition of <m>D</m> into the rectangles <m>D_{i,j}</m> also partitions <m>Q</m> into <m>nm</m> corresponding pieces which we call <m>Q_{i,j}=\vr(D_{i,j})</m>. From <xref ref="S-11-6-Parametric-Surfaces-Surface-Area"/> (specifically <xref ref="eq_11_6_parallelogram_area"/>) the surface area of <m>Q_{i,j}</m> is approximated by <m>SA_{i,j}=\vecmag{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s_i,t_j)}\Delta{s}\Delta{t}</m>.

  <p>
    So to measure the accumulation of the output of <m>f(x,y,z)</m> over <m>S_1</m> we use the following Riemann sum:
    <md>
      <mrow>\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} f(x_{i,j}^*,y_{i,j}^*,z_{i,j}^*) SA_{i,j}= </mrow>
      <mrow>\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} f(x(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*),y(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*),z(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*)) SA_{i,j}= </mrow>
      <mrow>\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} f(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*)) \Vert{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s_i,t_j)}\Vert \Delta{s}\Delta{t}</mrow>
    </md>
    This Riemann sum ends up being the double integral (over the variables <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>) of the function <m>f(x(t,s),y(s,t),z(s,t)) \Vert{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s,t)}\Vert</m>, which leads to the following theorem.

  <theorem xml:id="ScalarSurfaceIntDef">

  <title>Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals</title>
  <p>
    Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation. If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m> from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>, we denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m> that follows <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.  Also, if <m>C</m> is an oriented curve, <m>-C</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of definite integrals.

We will label the plot of land on Sugar Mountain <m>S_1</m> and the plot of land on Spice Mountain <m>S_2</m>. Unfortunately there are two types of toxic organisms on the surface of your new land (which may be why you got the land so cheap).

      We will spend the last part of this section looking at a couple of examples of how to compute scalar surface integrals using parameterizations of surfaces.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ScalarSurfaceInt_Example1">
      <p>
        Let us return to some of the problems from <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceInt_Sensemaking"/>. Specifically, we will compute the answer to <xref ref="task_SSIS_2"/>. We will compute <m>\iint_{S_1} x \enspace dS</m> where <m>S_1</m> is the top half (<m>z \geq 0</m>) of the sphere of radius one centered at the origin in 3-space. Our surface can be parameterized by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle \cos(s)\sin(t),\sin(s)\sin(t),\cos(t)\rangle</m> where <m>s \in [0,2\pi]</m> and <m>t \in [0,\pi]</m>. Using <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/>, we need to compute the partial derivatives of <m>\vr</m> with respect to <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, then compute <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert </m>. For our parameterization, we get
        <md>
          <mrow>\vr_s = \langle -\sin(s)\sin(t),\cos(s)\sin(t),0\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow>\vr_t = \langle \cos(s)\cos(t),\sin(s)\cos(t),-\sin(t)\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow>\vr_s \times \vr_t = \langle -(\sin(t))^2 \cos(s), \break - (\sin(t))^2 \sin(s), -(\cos(s))^2 \cos(t) \sin(t) -(\sin(s))^2 \cos(t) \sin(t) \rangle </mrow>
        </md>
        Simplifying <m>\vr_s \times \vr_t</m> we get
        <me> \vr_s \times \vr_t =\sin(t) \langle \cos(s)\sin(t),\sin(s)\sin(t),\cos(t) \rangle </me>
        Note that <m> \vr_s \times \vr_t = \sin(t) \vr(s,t)</m>. This should make sense because the normal vector to a sphere should be the outward pointing vector from the center of the sphere. Note here that <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert = \sin(t)</m> because <m>\Vert{\vr(s,t)}\Vert = 1</m> for any <m>s</m> or <m>t</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now use <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/> to compute the scalar surface integral as 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \iint_{S_1} x \enspace dS = \int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(s)\sin(t) (\sin(t)) \enspace ds dt
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            = \int_0^{\pi}(\sin(t))^2 dt [\sin(s)]|_{0}^{2\pi} = \int_0^{\pi}(\sin(t))^2 dt [0] =0
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This result should match your answer for <xref ref="task_SSIS_2"/> since the output of the function <m>f(x,y,z)=x</m> would be symmetric but opposite in sign for the parts of the surface in octants 1 and 4 as compared to octants 2 and 3.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="ScalarSurfaceInt_Example2">
    <p>
        For this example, we will compute the answer to <xref ref="task_SSIS_4"/>. We will compute <m>\iint_{S_3} x+z \enspace dS</m> where <m>S_3</m> is the disc of radius one centered at <m>(1,0,0)</m> on the <m>x=1</m> fundamental plane. Our surface can be parameterized by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle 1,s\cos(t),s\sin(t)\rangle</m> where <m>s \in [0,1]</m> and <m>t \in [0,2\pi]</m>. Using  <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/>, we need to compute the partial derivatives of <m>\vr</m> with respect to <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, then compute <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert </m>. For our parameterization, we get
        <md>
          <mrow> \vr_s = \langle 0, \cos(t), \sin(t) \rangle </mrow>
          <mrow> \vr_t = \langle 0, -s\sin(t), s\cos(t) \rangle </mrow>
          <mrow> \vr_s \times \vr_t = \langle 0, 0, s (\cos(t))^2+s (\sin(t))^2 \rangle </mrow>
        </md>
        Simplifying <m>\vr_s \times \vr_t</m> we get
        <me> \vr_s \times \vr_t =s \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle </me>
        and thus <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert = s</m>. This may be a familiar result from a change of coordinates between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates, <m>dA = dx dy = r dr d\theta</m>.

        We can now use  <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/> to compute the scalar surface integral as
        <md>
        <mrow> \iint_{S_3} x+z \enspace dS = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{1} (1+s\sin(t)) (s) ds dt </mrow>
        <mrow> = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{1} s+s^2\sin(t) ds dt </mrow>
        <mrow>  = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\sin(t) dt </mrow>
        <mrow>  = \frac{1}{2} (2\pi) + 0 = \pi </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This result should match your answer for <xref ref="task_SSIS_4"/> since the output of the function <m>f(x,y,z) = x+z</m> equals <m> 1+z</m>. The values of <m>z</m> will be symmetric but opposite in sign for the parts of the surface above and below the <m>xy</m>-plane. Thus the scalar surface integral will be one times the area of <m>S_3</m> which gives the value <m>\pi</m>.
