  <introduction>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt"/>, the idea of a flux integral was introduced by looking at how much of a vector field flows through a given section of a surface in space. In particular, the flux integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is orthogonal to the surface (which changes at different points on the surface.) <xref ref="thm_flux_int_calc"/> shows the best way to calculate the flux integral in terms of a parameterization of the surface. This was an extension of the method for computing the surface area given in <xref ref="S-11-6-Parametric-Surfaces-Surface-Area"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as we generalized line integrals of vector fields into scalar line integrals in <xref ref="S_Vector_ScalarLineIntegral"/>, we will spend this section looking at the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        How could we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a surface in space?
      </li>
      <li>
        What would that accmulation measure?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the most efficient way to calculate this?

  <subsection>
  <title>Defining surface integrals of scalar functions</title>  
  <p>
    In order to create a Riemann sum that will measure the acculumation of <m>f(x,y,z)</m>, a scalar valued function, over <m>S_1</m>, a smooth, bounded surface in space, we will break our surface into smaller piecese where we can approximate the output of <m>f</m> and the surface area of each piece. In <xref ref="SS-11-6-2-Surface-Area-Parametrically-Defined-Surfaces"/> and <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt"/>, we developed the way to measure surface area given a parameterization for the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that <m>S_1</m> is parametrized by <m>\vr(s,t)</m> with <m>a\leq s\leq b</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m>. In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice <m>a\leq s\leq b</m> into <m>n</m> equally-sized subintervals with endpoints <m>s_1,\ldots,s_n</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m> into <m>m</m> equally-sized subintervals with endpoints <m>t_1,\ldots,t_m</m>. This divides <m>D</m> into <m>nm</m>
    rectangles of size <m>\Delta{s}=\frac{b-a}{n}</m> by <m>\Delta{t}=\frac{d-c}{m}</m>. We index these rectangles as <m>D_{i,j}</m>. Every <m>D_{i,j}</m> has area (in the <m>st</m>-plane) of <m>\Delta{s}\Delta{t}</m>. The partition of <m>D</m> into the rectangles <m>D_{i,j}</m> also partitions <m>Q</m> into <m>nm</m> corresponding pieces which we call <m>Q_{i,j}=\vr(D_{i,j})</m>. From <xref ref="S-11-6-Parametric-Surfaces-Surface-Area"/> (specifically <xref ref="eq_11_6_parallelogram_area"/>) the surface area of <m>Q_{i,j}</m> is approximated by <m>SA_{i,j}=\vecmag{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s_i,t_j)}\Delta{s}\Delta{t}</m>.

  <p>
    So to measure the accumulation of the output of <m>f(x,y,z)</m> over <m>S_1</m>, we use the following Riemann sum:
    <md>
      <mrow>\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} f(x_{i,j}^*,y_{i,j}^*,z_{i,j}^*) SA_{i,j}= </mrow>
      <mrow>\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} f(x(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*),y(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*),z(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*)) SA_{i,j}= </mrow>
      <mrow>\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} f(s_{i}^*,t_{j}^*)) \Vert{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s_i,t_j)}\Vert \Delta{s}\Delta{t}</mrow>
    </md>
    This Riemann sum ends up being the double integral (over the variables <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>) of the function <m>f(x(t,s),y(s,t),z(s,t)) \Vert{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s,t)}\Vert</m>, which leads to the following theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="ScalarSurfaceIntDef">
    <statement>
    <p>
      Let a smooth surface <m>S_1</m> be parametrized by <m>\vr(s,t)</m> over a domain <m>D</m> and let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on a neighborhood around <m>S_1</m>. The acculumation of <m>f(x,y,z)</m> over <m>S_1</m> is deonted by <m>\iint_{S_1} f \enspace dS</m> and is called the scalar surface integral of <m>f</m> over <m>S_1</m>. The scalar surface integral of <m>f</m> over <m>S_1</m> is computed as
        <me>
          \iint_{S_1} f \enspace dS = \iint_D f(s,t) \Vert{(\vr_s \times \vr_t)(s,t)}\Vert \enspace dA
        </me>.

  </theorem>

  <example>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For our first part of our example, we will calculuate the scalar integral of <m>f(x,y,z)=x</m> on the surface <m>S_1</m> given by <m>x^2+y^2=z^2</m> such that <m>1\leq z \leq 3</m>. This is the same part of the cone used in <xref ref="flux_int_example1" />. Without using any calculations or parameterizations, we can reason that this scalar surface integral will be zero. In a scalar surface integral, we are calculating the accumulation of the scalar output over a surface area in space. In <xref ref="fig_Scalar_Surface_Int_Example1" />, you can see that we can symmetrically break our surface <m>S_1</m> into two regions that have exactly the same surface area properties <alert>and</alert> symmetric output values for our scalar function, <m>f</m>. The only difference between the red (<m>S_2</m>) and green (<m>S_3</m>) of <xref ref="fig_Scalar_Surface_Int_Example1" /> is that the output of <m>f</m> will be negative on the red surface <m>S_3</m> and positive on the green surface <m>S_2</m>. No matter how we break up the Riemann sum or the corresponding scalar surface integral for the green side of our surface, applying the same pattern to the red side will give the same result but with an opposite sign. In other words,
          <me>\int_{S_3} f \enspace dS = - \int_{S_2} f \enspace dS</me>.

          From a calculation standpoint, we can still verify this result using our parameterization from <xref ref="flux_int_example1" /> and <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef" />. Specifically, we will use the parameterization of <m>S_1</m> given by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle s \cos(t), s \sin(t), s \rangle </m> with bounds <m>1\leq s \leq 3</m> and <m>0 \leq t \lt 2 \pi</m>. We also know from <xref ref="flux_int_example1" /> that 
          <me>\vw= \vr_s \times \vr_t = \langle-s \cos(t), -s \sin(t), s \rangle </me>
          The length of <m>\vw</m> will be <m>\sqrt{s^2(\cos(t)^2+\sin(t)^2) +s^2}=2s</m>. Thus, <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef" /> gives 
          <me> \int_{S_1} f \enspace dS = \int_1^3 \int_0^{2\pi} (s \cos(t)) \enspace 2s dt ds =0</me>
          because the inside integral is <m>\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(t) dt = 0</m>.

          If we want to calculate the integral of <m>f(x,y,z) = x</m> over <m>S_2</m> given by <m>x^2+y^2=z^2</m> such that <m>1\leq z \leq 3</m> and <m>0\leq x </m>, then we have very little extra work to do. Only the bounds on the integral will change since we are using the same parameterization and function from the first example. We can use the parameterization given by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle s \cos(t), s \sin(t), s \rangle </m> with <m>1\leq s \leq 3</m> and <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq t \lt \frac{\pi}{2} </m>. The length of <m>\vw</m> will be <m>\sqrt{s^2(\cos(t)^2+\sin(t)^2) +s^2}=2s</m>. Thus, <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef" /> gives

          It should make sense to you why the result of <m>\int_{S_2} f \enspace dS</m> is positive because the output of our function is non-negative for all points on <m>S_2</m>. Remember that the Riemann sum used in calculating surface integrals of scalar functions is the product of the function's output on each piece times the estimate of the surface area. Thus, if the function's output is positive for all points on the surface, then the scalar surface integral will also be positive.

          For our last example, we will calculate
          <me>
            \int_{S_1} z-x^2 \enspace dS 
          </me>
          We can reuse the parameterization and calculations above for <m>S_1</m> here and skip right to setting up the iterated integral. We will take a moment here to note that converting our scalar function <m>g(x,y,z)= z-x^2</m> to a function of <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> will give <m>g(s,t)=s-s^2 \cos(t)^2</m>. Therefore, we get the following iterated integral
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{S_1} z-x^2 \enspace dS \amp =  \int_1^3 \int_{0}^{2 \pi} (s-s^2 \cos(t)^2) \enspace 2s dt ds</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \int_1^3 2s^2 [t-s(\frac{2t+\sin(2t)}{4})]_{|_{t=0}^{2 \pi}} \enspace  ds</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \int_1^3 2s^2 (-\pi (s-2)) \enspace  ds = -\frac{16\pi}{3}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This result is a bit more difficult to to make sense of as being negative. In <xref ref="fig_Scalar_Surface_Int_Example2" /> we have a plot of the surface <m>S_1</m> in blue and the parabolic cylinder surface given by <m>z-x^2=0</m> is plotted in yellow. The points on the yellow surface correspond to where our scalar function (<m>g(x,y,z)= z-x^2</m>) gives an output of zero. The points inside the parabolic cylinder have a <m>z</m>-coordinate greater than <m>x^2</m> (which means that <m>g</m> will have a positive output for these points.) The points outside of the parabolic cylinder have a <m>z</m>-coordinate less than <m>x^2</m> (which means that <m>g</m> will have a negative output for these points.) In order to make an argument about whether <m>\int_{S_1} z-x^2 \enspace dS</m> is positive/negative/zero, we will need to assess whether there is more surface area with a positive output of <m>g</m>, more with a negative output, or an equal amount of positive-negative outputs. Actually, our problem is even harder than this. Beacuse the Riemann sum is the product of the output for each piece of our surface times the surface area estimate, we will need to think about which points/pieces have larger or smaller outputs for <m>g</m>. This is <alert>VERY</alert> difficult in general because you will need to a systematic way of estimating both the output of <m>g</m> and the surface area of different pieces of your surface.

          In our case, there is more surface area of <m>S_1</m> inside the parabolic cylinder than outside. For <m>(x,y,z)</m> points that are far away from the yellow surface, the magnitude of the output of <m>g</m> for that point will be large. For <m>(x,y,z)</m> points that are close to the yellow surface, thier <m>z</m>-coordinates will be close to <m>x^2</m> and thus the output of <m>g</m> will be close to zero. This means that in order to properly estimate the scalar surface integral, we will need to assess whether there is a greater weighted surface area inside the parabolic cylinder than outside, where the weight of each surface area piece is given by how far the piece is from the yellow surface (the parabolic cylinder surface). This is not an easy argument to make and is not easy to verify visually for this example. For some examples you may be able to make a nice geometric arguement about the size of scalar surface integrals, but the algebraic calculation given by <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef" /> gives an exact value.

  <title>Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals</title>
  <p>
    Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation. If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m> from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>, we denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m> that follows <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.  Also, if <m>C</m> is an oriented curve, <m>-C</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of definite integrals.

        <p>
          In this activity, we will be explaining each of the
	  Properties from <xref ref="asm_ScalarLineInt_Properties" text="title"/> in the context of a new analogy. We have just purchased a plot of land that spans two mountains, Sugar Mountain and Spice Mountain. We will label the plot of land on Sugar Mountain <m>S_1</m> and the plot of land on Spice Mountain <m>S_2</m>. Unfortunately there are two types of toxic organisms on the surface of your new land (which may be why you got the land so cheap). Let <m>f</m> be the density of the toxic fungus on your new plot of land and let <m>g</m> be the density of toxic bacteria on the new plot.

            The scalar surface integral <m>\iint_{S_1} f \enspace dS</m> would calculate the accumulation of toxic fungus on the Sugar Mountain part of your plot. In particular, <m>\iint_{S_1} f \enspace dS</m> measures the total amount of toxic fungus on your Sugar Mountain land.

      We will spend the last part of this section looking at a couple of examples of how to compute scalar surface integrals using parameterizations of surfaces.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ScalarSurfaceInt_Example1">
      <p>
        Let us return to some of the problems from <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceInt_Sensemaking"/>. Specifically, we will compute the answer to <xref ref="task_SSIS_2"/>. We will compute <m>\iint_{S_1} x \enspace dS</m> where <m>S_1</m> is the top half (<m>z \geq 0</m>) of the sphere of radius one centered at the origin in 3-space. Our surface can be parameterized by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle \cos(s)\sin(t),\sin(s)\sin(t),\cos(t)\rangle</m> where <m>s \in [0,2\pi]</m> and <m>t \in [0,\pi]</m>. Using <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/>, we need to compute the partial derivatives of <m>\vr</m> with respect to <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, then compute <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert </m>. For our parameterization, we get
        <md>
          <mrow>\vr_s \amp = \langle -\sin(s)\sin(t),\cos(s)\sin(t),0\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow>\vr_t \amp = \langle \cos(s)\cos(t),\sin(s)\cos(t),-\sin(t)\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow>\vr_s \times \vr_t \amp = \langle -(\sin(t))^2 \cos(s), </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp \quad \quad - (\sin(t))^2 \sin(s), -(\cos(s))^2 \cos(t) \sin(t) -(\sin(s))^2 \cos(t) \sin(t) \rangle </mrow>
        </md>
        Simplifying <m>\vr_s \times \vr_t</m> we get
        <me> \vr_s \times \vr_t =\sin(t) \langle \cos(s)\sin(t),\sin(s)\sin(t),\cos(t) \rangle </me>
        Note that <m> \vr_s \times \vr_t = \sin(t) \vr(s,t)</m>. This should make sense because the normal vector to a sphere should be the outward pointing vector from the center of the sphere. Note here that <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert = \sin(t)</m> because <m>\Vert{\vr(s,t)}\Vert = 1</m> for any <m>s</m> or <m>t</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now use <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/> to compute the scalar surface integral as 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \iint_{S_1} x \enspace dS = \int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(s)\sin(t) (\sin(t)) \enspace ds dt
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            = \int_0^{\pi}(\sin(t))^2 dt [\sin(s)]|_{0}^{2\pi} = \int_0^{\pi}(\sin(t))^2 dt [0] =0
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This result should match your answer for <xref ref="task_SSIS_2"/> since the output of the function <m>f(x,y,z)=x</m> would be symmetric but opposite in sign for the parts of the surface in octants 1 and 4 as compared to octants 2 and 3.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="ScalarSurfaceInt_Example2">
    <p>
        For this example, we will compute the answer to <xref ref="task_SSIS_4"/>. We will compute <m>\iint_{S_3} x+z \enspace dS</m> where <m>S_3</m> is the disc of radius one centered at <m>(1,0,0)</m> on the <m>x=1</m> fundamental plane. Our surface can be parameterized by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle 1,s\cos(t),s\sin(t)\rangle</m> where <m>s \in [0,1]</m> and <m>t \in [0,2\pi]</m>. Using  <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/>, we need to compute the partial derivatives of <m>\vr</m> with respect to <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, then compute <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert </m>. For our parameterization, we get
        <md>
          <mrow> \vr_s = \langle 0, \cos(t), \sin(t) \rangle </mrow>
          <mrow> \vr_t = \langle 0, -s\sin(t), s\cos(t) \rangle </mrow>
          <mrow> \vr_s \times \vr_t = \langle 0, 0, s (\cos(t))^2+s (\sin(t))^2 \rangle </mrow>
        </md>
        Simplifying <m>\vr_s \times \vr_t</m> we get
        <me> \vr_s \times \vr_t =s \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle </me>
        and thus <m>\Vert{\vr_s \times \vr_t}\Vert = s</m>. This may be a familiar result from a change of coordinates between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates, <m>dA = dx dy = r dr d\theta</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now use  <xref ref="ScalarSurfaceIntDef"/> to compute the scalar surface integral as
        <md>
        <mrow> \iint_{S_3} x+z \enspace dS = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{1} (1+s\sin(t)) (s) ds dt </mrow>
        <mrow> = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{1} s+s^2\sin(t) ds dt </mrow>
        <mrow>  = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\sin(t) dt </mrow>
        <mrow>  = \frac{1}{2} (2\pi) + 0 = \pi </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This result should match your answer for <xref ref="task_SSIS_4"/> since the output of the function <m>f(x,y,z) = x+z</m> equals <m> 1+z</m>. The values of <m>z</m> will be symmetric but opposite in sign for the parts of the surface above and below the <m>xy</m>-plane. Thus the scalar surface integral will be one times the area of <m>S_3</m> which gives the value <m>\pi</m>.
