<introduction>
  <p>
    As we saw in <xref ref="S_Vector_VectorFields"/>, there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is <q>Where exactly is the vector field created?</q> With the vector field in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Div_vf1"/>, imagine sketching a curve that follows the direction of the vector field by treating the vectors in the vector field as tangent vectors to your curve. No matter where you start, you should observe that the vector field decreases in strength as you move along the flow. We wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.

        In this preview activity, we will look at several two-dimensional vector fields and try to assess when the vector field has increased or decreased in strength over a given region. We begin with graphs of the three vector fields, <m>\vF</m>, <m>\vG</m>, and <m>\vH</m>. Parts <xref ref="task_PA_Vector_Div_InOut" text="local"/>, <xref ref="task_PA_Vector_Div_CreateDestroy" text="local"/>, and <xref ref="task_PA_Vector_Div_Smaller" text="local"/> ask you to answer the same three questions about the vector field and square illustrated in each of the figures. <xref ref="task_PA_Vector_Div_P4P5P6" text="local">Part</xref> asks you to think further about the third vector field.

  <title>Alternative Notation for Divergence</title>
  <p>
    In other sources you may see the divergence written using a dot product as <m>\divg(\vF) = \nabla\cdot \vF</m>.
    <!--<md>
    <mrow>
    	\divg(\vF) \amp = \nabla \cdot \vF = 
    	\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle \cdot \langle F_1,F_2,F_3 \rangle 
    	</mrow>
    	<mrow> \amp= 
    	    	\frac{\partial}{\partial
    		x}(F_1)+\frac{\partial}{\partial
    		y}(F_2)+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(F_3) =
    		\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial
    		F_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}
    	</mrow>
    </md>.-->
    This notation is very compact and works well with the understanding that the del operator <m>\nabla = \langle
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle</m> is a function that operates on other functions. However, this notation can also be confusing because of its emphasis on computation rather than conceptual understanding. In this text, we will not generally write the divergence using the del operator.
  </p>

<p>
  The divergence of a vector field is a scalar measurement at a point that measures how the strength of the vectof field is changing as we look small neighborhoods around our point. While <xref ref="SS_Vector_Div_Development"/> will show the details for how the divergence is defined, we can make the following qualitative argument: If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point <m>(a,b)</m>, then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. We make this measurement of changing strength of the vector field by measureing how much of a vector field flows into versus out of a small neighborhood of our point (as was done in <xref ref="PA_Vector_Div" />). When looking at a small neighborhood of the point (as shown by the square in <xref ref="fig_S_Vector_Div_box" />), only the change of the horizontal component of the vector field contributes to flow in or out on the sides and only the change in the vertical component contributes to flow in or our on the top and bottom.
</p>

<example>
  <p>
    Let <m>\vF=\langle x, y \rangle</m>. Then <m>\divg(\vF)= \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (x)+ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (y) = 1+1=2</m>. From our conceptual description above, <m>\divg(\vF)</m> being positive means that our vector field is increasing in strength. Since the divergence of <m>\vF</m> does not have a dependence on the input point, that means the vector field is increasing in strength, regardless of which point we consider. In the interactive element below, you can change the point you would like plotted and the size of the region around the point. You should see that regardless of what point you select or how small you make the region around the point, there will be more of the vector field flowing out of the region than in.

In constrast to the previous examples, you can see that the value of divergence of <m>\vH</m> will depend on the input point choosen.

    The divergence of <m>\vH</m> at the point <m>(-1,1)</m> will be zero. If you look at this point in <xref ref="fig_div_ex3" />, you will see that there is exactly as much of the vector field flowing into the region around <m>(-1,1)</m> as is flowing out.
  </p>
  <p>
    The divergence of <m>\vH</m> at the point <m>(-2,0)</m> is <m>-4</m>. This should mean that there is more of the vector field flowing into the region around <m>(-2,0)</m> than is flowing out. You should be able to see how difference regions of the <m>xy</m>-plane will have different values for <m>\divg(\vH)</m>.
  </p>
</example>
  <p>
    Another way to <q>see</q> divergence on a vector field plot is to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does
      not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector field, then the divergence is zero. Also, remember that the divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and will change depending on location. The next activity asks you to graphically examine the divergence of three vector fields.

  <title> Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field</title>
  <p>
      In this section, we will go through the details for how to measure the density of the <q>creation</q> or
      <q>destruction</q> of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point. Next, using a limit, we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because vector fields change in a continuous fashion, the vector fields don't actually change <em>at a single point</em>. Rather, we will measure the density for the change in strength of the vector field.
  </p>

      We will develop all of our measurements in a two dimensional setting for now. However, our arguments can be applied to three (or more) dimensions. We start in the same fashion as in <xref ref="PA_Vector_Div"/>. Namely, we will look at how much of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered at a point <m>(a,b)</m>. For this development, we will consider a two-dimensional vector field given by <m>\vF(x,y)=\langle{F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y)}\rangle</m>.
  </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
    We can parametrize the top edge of the box (in blue) by <m>\vr_{\text{top}}(t) = \langle a+t,b+h\rangle</m> with <m> -h\leq t\leq h</m>. Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized by
    <ul>
      <li><m>\vr_{\text{bottom}}(t) = \langle a+t,b-h\rangle</m> </li>
      <li><m>\vr_{\text{right}}(t) = \langle a+h,b+t\rangle</m> </li>
      <li><m>\vr_{\text{left}}(t) = \langle a-h,b+t\rangle</m></li>
    </ul>
    all of which use the parameter values in <m> -h\leq t\leq h</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The amount of the vector field <m>\vF</m> that is created inside the square around the point <m>(a,b)</m> can be measured by the net amount of the vector field coming in or going out of the square. The amount of vector flow that goes through each of the boundary segments can be measured by looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field on each particular segment. For instance, on the top segment (in blue), the vertical component <m>F_2</m> determines how much of the vector field goes in or out of the square. Integrating just the vertical component <m>F_2</m> of the vector field <m>\vF</m> over the points on the top segment of our square will therefore measure how much of the vector field goes through the top of the square.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square (in orange). Similarly, if we want to measure how much of <m>\vF</m> goes through either the left or right side of the square, we need to integrate the horizontal component <m>F_1</m>. Hence, the net flow of the vector field into or out of the square will be given by
    <!--TODO: MTK changed to men and put on a (bad) xml:id, so now can reference in the right spot. -->
    <md xml:id="eqn_Vector_Div_MVT">
      <mrow>\int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt </mrow>
      <mrow>\quad + \int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt</mrow>
    </md>
    Notice that the integrals corresponding to the left and bottom segments are subtracted because we need to pay attention to the orientation of the vector field relative to the square. A positive vertical component of the vector field (<m>F_2</m>) will correspond to flow out on the top of the square but will correspond to the vector field flowing into the square on the bottom. In the integrals above, we are counting the flow out of the square as positive and the flow in as negative.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are measuring the net flow through the square as a scalar quantity. By decreasing <m>h</m>, we can look at what happens to our amount of flow out of the square as we shrink to the point <m>(a,b)</m>. In order for this to make sense across different size of squares, we will change what we are measuring to be a density argument by calculating flow in (or out) per unit area. This will allow us to compare our net flow calculations across squares with different areas. In other words, we want to consider what happens to

      <mrow>\frac{1}{(2h)^2}\left(\int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt \right.</mrow>

    </md>
    as <m>h</m> goes to zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we apply our limit, we will take a moment to simplify our integrals in order to make the limit easier to evaluate. In particular, we will apply the Mean Value Theorem to each of four the integrals above. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to the first integral gives
    <me> 
      \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt = (2h) \enspace F_2(t^*_1,b+h)
    </me>,
    where <m>t^*_1</m> is some value in the interval <m>(a-h,a+h)</m>. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to each of the
    other integrals yields
    <md>
      <mrow> \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt </mrow>
      <mrow> \quad + \int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt </mrow>
      <mrow> (2h) \left(F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)+F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)\right) </mrow>
    </md>
    where <m>t^*_1,t^*_2</m> are values in <m>(a-h,a+h)</m> and <m>t^*_3,t^*_4</m> are values in <m>(b-h,b+h)</m>. Thus our flow density can be measured by looking at the limit as <m>h\to 0</m> of the net flow (in or out) over the square divided by the area of the square.
    <md>
      <mrow>\text{Flow Density}(a,b)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\text{net flow}}{\text{area}} </mrow>
      <mrow>\quad = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{(2h) \left(F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)+F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)\right)}{4h^2}</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    To simplify the limit further, we will reorganize our limit expression. Specifically, we collect the <m>F_2</m> and <m>F_1</m> terms separately. This gives
    <md>
      <mrow>\text{Flow Density}(a,b) = </mrow>
      <mrow>\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\left[ \frac{F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)}{2h}+\frac{F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)}{2h}\right]</mrow>
    </md>
    Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html#VjW" visual="activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html#VjW">Section 1.5.2</url> and as <m>h\to 0</m>, the numbers <m>t^*_1,t^*_2</m> must go to <m>a</m> and <m>t^*_3,t^*_4</m> must go to <m>b</m>. Therefore, after evaluating our limit, the flow density is
    <me> 
      \text{Flow Density}(a,b)= \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} (a,b)+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} (a,b)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this simplification may seem a bit amazing and magical, our conceptual steps should help us make sense of the result. If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point <m>(a,b)</m> then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. How the horizontal component changes over small steps in the vertical direction will give us information about how the direction of the vector field changes but not how the
    strength of the vector field is changing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The arguments we made about measuring how much of the vector field flows into or out of a square has straightforward generalization to three (or more) dimensions. However, doing so requires a method for measuring how much of a vector field flows through a surface. This will be the subject of <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt"/>.

          The divergence of a vector field measures the density of change in the strength of the vector field. In other words, the divergence measures the instantaneous rate of change in the strength of the vector field along the direction of flow.
