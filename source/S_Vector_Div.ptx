<introduction>
<p>
As we saw in <xref ref="S_Vector_VectorFields" />, there are many
physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural
question is <q>Where exactly is the vector field created?</q> With the
vector field in <xref ref="fig_Vector_Div_vf1" />, imagine sketching a
curve that follows the direction of the vector field by treating the
vectors in the vector field as tangent vectors to your curve. No
matter where you start, you should observe that the vector field
decreases in strength as you move along the flow. We wish to
understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field
is created (or destroyed) at a given location.

<subsection xml:id="SS_Vector_Div_Development">
    <title> Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field</title>
    <p>
        In this section, we will go through the process for how to
        measure the density of the <q>creation</q> or
        <q>destruction</q> of the vector field in a classic calculus
        fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the
        vector field changes in a region around a point. Next, using a
        limit, we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink
        the region. Because our vector fields will change in a
        continuous fashion, we won't have the vector field actually
        change at a single point. Rather, we will really be measuring
        the density for the change in strength of the vector field.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will develop all of our measurements in a two dimensional
        setting for now. However, our arguments can be applied to
        three (or more) dimensions. We start in the same fashion as in
        <xref ref="PA_Vector_Div" />. Namely, we will look at how much
        of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered
        at a point <m>(a,b)</m>. For this development, we will
        consider a two-dimensional vector field given by
        <m>\vF(x,y)=\langle{F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y)}\rangle</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_S_Vector_Div_box">
      <caption>A square around the point <m>(a,b)</m></caption>
      <image width="55%" source="/fig_12_5_box.svg">
	<description>A square with sides parallel to the coordinate
	axes and centered at the point <m>(a,b)</m>. The upper-right
	corner of the square is labeled <m>(a+h,b+h)</m>.
	</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
        We can parametrize the top edge of the box (in blue) by
        <m>\vr_{\text{top}}(t) = \langle a+t,b+h\rangle</m> with <m>
        -h\leq t\leq h</m>. Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can
        be parametrized by <m>\vr_{\text{bottom}}(t) = \langle
        a+t,b-h\rangle</m>, <m>\vr_{\text{right}}(t) = \langle
        a+h,b+t\rangle</m>, and <m>\vr_{\text{left}}(t) = \langle
        a-h,b+t\rangle</m> with <m> -h\leq t\leq h</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of the vector field <m>\vF</m> that is created
        inside the square around the point <m>(a,b)</m> can be
        measured by the net amount of the vector field coming in or
        going out of the square. The amount of vector flow that goes
        through each of the boundary segments can be measured by
        looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field
        on each particular segment. For instance, on the top segment
        (in blue), the vertical component <m>F_2</m> determines how
        much of the vector field goes in or out of the
        square. Integrating just the vertical component <m>F_2</m> of
        the vector field <m>\vF</m> over the points on the top
        segment of our square will therefore measure how much of the
        vector field goes through the top of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square (in
        orange). Similarly, if we want to measure how much of
        <m>\vF</m> goes through either the left or right side of the
        square, we need to integrate the horizontal component
        <m>F_1</m>. Hence, the net flow of the vector field into or
        out of the square will be given by
	<!--TODO: MTK changed to men and put on a (bad) xml:id, so now
	     can reference in the right spot. -->
	<men xml:id="eqn_Vector_Div_MVT">
          \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt \\
          \quad + \int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt
   	</men>
        Notice that some of the integrals are subtracted because we
        need to pay attention to the orientation of the vector field
        relative to the square. A positive vertical component of the
        vector field (<m>F_2</m>) will correspond to flow out on the
        top of the square but will correspond to the vector field
        flowing into the square on the bottom. So in the integrals
        above, we are counting the flow out of the square as positive
        and the flow in as negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are measuring the net flow through the square as a scalar
      quantity. We can look at what happens to our scalar quantity as
      we shrink the square to the point <m>(a,b)</m> by decreasing
      <m>h</m>. In order for this to make the most sense, we will
      change our measurement to be a density argument by calculating
      flow in (or out) per unit area. This will allow us to compare
      our net flow calculations across squares with different
      areas. In other words, we want to consider what happens to
        <me>
    	    \frac{1}{(2h)^2}\left(\int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt  \\
            \quad \quad +\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t) dt \right)
        </me>
        as <m>h</m> goes to zero. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We will take a moment here before we apply our limit to simplify
      our integrals in order to make the limit easier to evaluate. In
      particular, we will apply the Mean Value Theorem to each of four
      the integrals above. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to the
      first integral gives
      <me> 
        \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt = (2h) F_2(t^*_1,b+h)
      </me>,
      where <m>t^*_1</m> is some value in the interval <m>
      (a-h,a+h)</m>. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to each of the
      other integrals yields
      <me>
	\int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b+h) dt - \int_{-h}^{h} F_2(a+t,b-h) dt
	+ \\ \int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a+h,b+t) dt -\int_{-h}^{h} F_1(a-h,b+t)
	dt = \\ (2h)
	\left(F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)+F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)\right)
	</me>, where <m>t^*_1,t^*_2</m> are values in <m>(a-h,a+h)</m>
	and <m>t^*_3,t^*_4</m> are values in <m>(b-h,b+h)</m>. Thus
	our flow density can be measured by looking at the limit as
	<m>h\to 0</m> of the net flow (in or out) over the square
	divided by the area of the square.
      <me> 
        \text{Flow Density}(a,b)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\text{net flow}}{\text{area}} =\\
    	\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{(2h) \left(F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)+F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)\right)}{4h^2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify the limit further, we will reorganize our limit
      expression. Specifically, we collect the <m>F_2</m> and
      <m>F_1</m> terms separately. This gives
      <me> 
        \text{Flow Density}(a,b)= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\left[
        \frac{F_1(a+h,t^*_3)-F_1(a-h,t^*_1)}{2h}+\frac{F_2(t^*_1,b+h)-F_2(t^*_2,b-h)}{2h}\right]
      </me>
      Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives
      from <url
      href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html#VjW" visual="activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html#VjW">Section
      1.5.2</url> and
      notice that as <m>h\to 0</m>, the numbers <m>t^*_1,t^*_2</m>
      must go to <m>a</m> and <m>t^*_3,t^*_4</m> must go to
      <m>b</m>. Therefore, after evaluating our limit, the flow
      density is
      <me> 
        \text{Flow Density}(a,b)= \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} (a,b)+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} (a,b)
	</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this simplification may seem a bit amazing and magical,
      our conceptual steps should help us make sense of the result. If
      we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is
      changing in a small neighborhood of the point <m>(a,b)</m> then
      we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is
      changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing
      vertically. How the horizontal component changes over small
      steps in the vertical direction will give us information about
      how the direction of the vector field changes but not how the
      strength of the vector field is changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments we made about measuring how much of the vector
      field flows into or out of a square has straightforward
      generalization to three (or more) dimensions. However, doing so
      requires a method for measuring how much of a vector field flows
      through a surface. This will be the subject of <xref
      ref="S_Vector_FluxInt" />.

    <title>Definition of the Divergence of a Vector Field</title>
    <p>
      In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of the flow
      density at a point as giving a measurement of the how the
      strength of the vector field changes by using a density
      argument. The standard name for this quantity is the divergence
      of a vector field, which we now formally define.

      <title>Alternative Notation for Divergence</title>
    <p>
      In other sources you may see the divergence written using a dot
      product as <m>\divg(\vF) = \nabla\cdot \vF</m>.
      <!--<md>
	<mrow>
	\divg(\vF) \amp = \nabla \cdot \vF = 
	\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle \cdot \langle F_1,F_2,F_3 \rangle

		\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial
		F_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}
	</mrow>
      </md>.-->  This notation is very compact and works well with the
      understanding that the del operator <m>\nabla = \langle
      \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial
      y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle</m> is a function that
      operates on other functions. However, this notation can also be
      confusing because of its emphasis on computation rather
      than conceptual understanding. In this text, we will not
      generally write the divergence using the del operator.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Another way to <q>see</q> divergence on a vector field plot is
      to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move
      along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is
      increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector
      field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is
      decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector
      field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does
      not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector
      field, then the divergence is zero. Also, remember that the
      divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and
      will change depending on location. The next activity asks you to
      graphically examine the divergence of three vector fields.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The divergence of a vector field <m>\vF(x,y)=\langle F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y)\rangle</m> is computed as 
          <me>
            \divg(\vF)=\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y}
          </me>
          In three dimensions, the divergence of the vector field
          <m>\vG(x,y)=\langle{G_1(x,y,z),G_2(x,y,z),G_3(x,y,z)}\rangle</m> is computed as
          <me> 
            \divg(\vG)=\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial G_3}{\partial z}
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The divergence of a vector field measures the density of change in the strength of the vector field. In other words, the divergence measures the instantaneous rate of change in the strength of the vector field along the direction of flow.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The accumulation of the divergence over a region of space will measure the net amount of the vector field that exits (versus enters) the region.

Keep this simple as will be made public <q>back of the book</q>-style. <alert>Do not put anything with a number/or <attr>xml:id</attr> on it in an <tag>answer</tag> or <tag>solution</tag>, because this will mess up the numbering of subsequent things in the book. Technically <attr>xml:id</attr> is fine, but note that the reference might not be useful in the end.
