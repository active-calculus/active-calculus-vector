    <introduction>
    <p>
      We learn in single-variable calculus that the derivative is a useful tool for finding the local maxima
      and minima of functions, and that these ideas may often be employed in applied settings. In particular, if a function <m>f</m>,
      such as the one shown in <xref ref="F_10_7_preview_1">Figure</xref> is everywhere
      differentiable, we know that the tangent line is horizontal at any point
      where <m>f</m> has a local maximum or minimum. This, of course, means that the derivative <m>f'</m> is zero at any such point. Hence, one way that we seek extreme values of a given function is to first find where the derivative of the function is zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      In multivariable calculus, we are often similarly interested in finding the greatest and/or least value(s) that a function may achieve. Moreover, there are many applied settings in which a quantity of interest depends on several different variables. In the following preview activity, we begin to see how some key ideas in multivariable calculus can help us answer such questions by thinking about the geometry of the surface generated by a function of two variables.

  <subsection>
    <title>Extrema and Critical Points</title>
    <p>
      One of the important applications of single-variable calculus is the use of derivatives to identify local extremes of functions (that is, local maxima and local minima). Using the tools we have developed so far, we can naturally extend
      the concept of local maxima and minima to several-variable functions.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function of two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The function <m>f</m> has a <em>local maximum</em> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that <m>f(x,y) \leq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.  In this situation we say that <m>f(x_0, y_0)</m> is a <em>local maximum
                            value</em>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The function <m>f</m> has a <em>local minimum</em> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that <m>f(x,y) \geq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this situation we say that <m>f(x_0, y_0)</m> is a <em>local minimum value</em>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                An <em>absolute maximum point</em> is a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> for  which <m>f(x,y)\leq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> in the
                          domain of <m>f</m>. The value of <m>f</m> at an absolute maximum point is the <em>maximum value</em> of <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                An <em>absolute minimum point</em> is a point such that <m>f(x,y) \geq f(x_0,y_0)</m> for all points <m>(x,y)</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>. The value of <m>f</m> at an absolute minimum point is the <em>minimum value</em> of <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We use the term <em>extremum point</em> to refer to any point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> at which <m>f</m> has a local maximum or minimum. In addition, the function value
      <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> at an extremum is called an <em>extremal value</em>. <xref ref="F_10_7_extrema">Figure</xref> illustrates the graphs of two functions
      that have an absolute maximum and minimum, respectively, at the origin
      <m>(x_0,y_0) = (0,0)</m>.

    <p>
      In single-variable calculus, we saw that the extrema of a continuous function <m>f</m> always occur at <em>critical points</em>, values of <m>x</m> where <m>f</m> fails to be differentiable or where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. Said differently, critical points provide the locations where extrema of a function may appear. Our work in <xref ref="PA_10_7">Preview Activity</xref> suggests that something similar happens with two-variable functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that a continuous function <m>f</m> has an extremum at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this
      case, the trace <m>f(x,y_0)</m> has an extremum at <m>x_0</m>, which means
      that <m>x_0</m> is a critical value of <m>f(x,y_0)</m>. Therefore,
      either <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> does not exist or <m>f_x(x_0,y_0) = 0</m>.
      Similarly, either <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> does not exist or <m>f_y(x_0,y_0) =
      0</m>. This implies that the extrema of a two-variable function occur at points that satisfy the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>critical point</term><idx><h>critical point</h></idx>
          <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> of a function <m>f=f(x,y)</m> is a point in the domain of <m>f</m>
          at which <m>f_x(x_0,y_0) = 0</m> and
          <m>f_y(x_0,y_0) = 0</m>, or such that one of
          <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> or <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m>
          fails to exist.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We can therefore find critical points of a function <m>f</m> by computing partial derivatives and identifying any values of <m>(x,y)</m> for which one of the partials doesn't exist or for which both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. For the latter, note that we have to solve the system of equations

              In this example,

              The graph of <m>f</m> is a hyberbolic paraboloid that makes a saddle shape around the origin,

              In this case we will never have <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m>,
              but <m>\nabla f</m> will fail to exist when <m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>.
              This gives us infinitely many critical points <mdash/> all points of the form <m>(0,y)</m> or <m>(x,0)</m>.
              The graph of <m>f</m> has sharp folds along the <m>x</m>-axis or <m>y</m>-axis,
              so we should expect that <m>f</m> is not differentiable at those points.
              The graph of <m>f</m> also indicates that <m>f</m> has an absolute minimum value at the point <m>(0,0)</m>.

              So <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when <m>2(y - 2) = 0</m> and <m>2(x + 1) = 0</m>,
              or at the point <m>(-1, 2)</m>.
              Thus, <m>(-1, 2)</m> is the only critical point of <m>f</m>.
              The graph of <m>f</m> is a hyperbolic paraboloid, so we can expect that it has only one critical point

    <title>Classifying Critical Points: The Second Derivative Test</title>
    <p>
      While the extrema of a continuous function <m>f</m> always occur at critical points,
      it is important to note that not every critical point leads to
      an extremum. Recall, for instance, <m>f(x) = x^3</m> from single variable calculus. We know that <m>x_0=0</m> is a critical point since <m>f'(x_0) = 0</m>, but <m>x_0 = 0</m> is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A similar situation may arise in a multivariable setting. Consider the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2</m> whose graph and contour
      plot are shown in <xref ref="F_10_7_saddle">Figure</xref>. Because <m>\nabla f =
      \langle 2x, -2y\rangle</m>, we see that the origin <m>(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)</m> is a
      critical point. However, this critical point is neither a local maximum or minimum; the origin is a local minimum on the trace defined by <m>y=0</m>, while the origin is a local maximum on the trace defined by <m>x=0</m>. We call such a critical point a <em>saddle point</em> due to the shape of the graph near the critical point.
    </p>

    <p>
      As in single-variable calculus, we would like to have some sort of test to help us identify whether a critical point is a local maximum, local maximum, or neither.

          Our goal in this activity is to understand a similar test for classifying extreme values of functions of two variables. Consider the following three functions:
          <me> f_1(x,y) = 4-x^2-y^2, \ \ f_2(x,y) = x^2+y^2, \ \ f_3(x,y) = x^2-y^2. </me>
          You can verify that each function has a critical point at the origin <m>(0,0)</m>. You should check this.

                There is no single second derivative of a function of two variables, so we consider a quantity that combines the second order partial derivatives.

                Now consider the cases where <m>D \gt 0</m>. It is in these cases that a function has a local maximum or minimum at a point. What is necessary in these cases is to find a condition that will distinguish between a maximum and a minimum. In the cases where  <m>D \gt 0</m> at the origin, evaluate <m>f_{xx}(0,0)</m>. What value does <m>f_{xx}(0,0)</m> have when <m>f</m> has a local maximum value at the origin? When <m>f</m> has a local minimum value at the origin? Explain why. (Hint: This should look very similar to the Second Derivative Test for functions of a single variable.) What would happen if we considered the values of <m>f_{yy}(0,0)</m> instead?

              To find the critical points,
              we determine the points in the domain of <m>f</m> where
              <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> or <m>\nabla f</m> does not exist.
              Now
              <me>
                \nabla f = \langle 9x^2-9, 2y+4 \rangle
              </me>,
              and so <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when <m>9x^2-9 = 0</m> and <m>2y+4 = 0</m>.
              The critical points of <m>f</m> are then <m>(1,-2)</m> and <m>(-1,-2)</m>.
              To classify these critical points with the Second Derivative Test,
              we need the second order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>.
              Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us
              <me>
                \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 18x, \ \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = 2, \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = 0
              </me>.
              Then
              <me>
                D(1,-2) = f_{xx}(1,-2)f_{yy}(1,-2) - \left(f_{xy}(1,-2)\right)^2 = (18)(2) - (0)^2 = 36
              </me>.
              That <m>D(1,-2) \gt 0</m> and
              <m>f_{xx}(1,-2) \gt 0</m> tells us that <m>f</m> has a relative minimum at <m>(1,-2)</m>.
              Also,
              <me>
                D(-1,-2) = f_{xx}(-1,-2)f_{yy}(-1,-2) - \left(f_{xy}(-1,-2)\right)^2 = (-18)(2) - (0)^2 = -36
              </me>.
              That <m>D(-1,-2) \lt  0</m> tells us that <m>f</m> has a saddle point at <m>(-1,-2)</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              To find the critical points,
              we determine the points in the domain of <m>f</m> (<m>x \neq 0</m> and <m>y \neq 0</m>) where
              <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> or <m>\nabla f</m> does not exist.
              Now
              <me>
                \nabla f = \left\langle y-\frac{2}{x^2}, x-\frac{4}{y^2} \right\rangle
              </me>,
              and so <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when
              <md>
                <mrow>y-\frac{2}{x^2} \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x-\frac{4}{y^2} \amp = 0</mrow>
              </md>.
              The first equation tells us that <m>y = \frac{2}{x^2}</m>.
              Substituting into the second equation shows that
              <md>
                <mrow>x - \frac{4}{\left(\frac{2}{x^2}\right)^2} \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x - \frac{4x^4}{4} \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x - x^4 \amp = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x(1-x^3) \amp = 0</mrow>
              </md>.
              So <m>x = 0</m> or <m>1-x^3 = 1</m>.
              This gives us <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=1</m>.
              Now <m>x=0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
              so we only consider <m>x=1</m>.
              Then <m>y = \frac{2}{1^2} = 2</m>.
              Thus, the only critical point of <m>f</m> is <m>(1,2)</m>.
              To classify this critical point with the Second Derivative Test,
              we need the second order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>.
              Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us
              <me>
                \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \frac{4}{x^3}, \ \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = \frac{8}{y^3}, \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = 1
              </me>.
              Then
              <me>
                D(1,2) = f_{xx}(1,2)f_{yy}(1,2) - \left(f_{xy}(1,2)\right)^2 = (4)(1) - (1)^2 = 3
              </me>.
              That <m>D(1,2) \gt 0</m> and
              <m>f_{xx}(1,2) \gt 0</m> tells us that <m>f</m> has a relative minimum at <m>(1,2)</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To find the critical points,
              we determine the points in the domain of <m>f</m> where
              <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> or <m>\nabla f</m> does not exist.
              Now
              <me>
                \nabla f = \langle 3x^2-3y, 3y^2 - 3x \rangle
              </me>,
              and so <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m> when <m>3x^2-3y = 0</m> and <m>3y^2 - 3x = 0</m>. Solving these equations simultaneously yields the critical points of <m>(0, 0)</m> and <m>(1, 1)</m>.
              To classify these critical points with the Second Derivative Test,
              we need the second order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>.
              Differentiating the first order partial derivatives gives us
              <me>
                \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 6x, \ \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = 6y, \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = -3
              </me>.
              Then
              <me>
                D(0, 0) = f_{xx}(0, 0)f_{yy}(0 0) - \left(f_{xy}(0, 0)\right)^2 = (0)(0) - (-3)^2 = -9
              </me>.
              That <m>D(0, 0) \lt 0</m> tells us that <m>f</m> has a saddle point at <m>(0, 0)</m>.
              Also, 
              <me>
                D(1,1) = f_{xx}(1, 1)f_{yy}(1, 1) - \left(f_{xy}(1, 1)\right)^2 = (6)(6) - (-3)^2 = 36 - 9 = 27
              </me>.
              Since <m>D(1, 1) \gt  0</m>   and
              <m>f_{xx}(1,1) \gt 0</m>, we determine that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>(1, 1)</m>.

      As we learned in single-variable calculus, finding extremal values of functions can be particularly useful in applied settings. For instance, we can often use calculus to determine the least expensive way to construct something or to find the most efficient route between two locations. The same possibility holds in settings with two or more variables.

          While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is often a function of the price of the product, the demand for a product may also depend on the price of other products.

          The seller would like to set the prices <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> in order to maximize revenue. We will assume that the seller meets the full demand for each product.

      absolute maximum or minimum at each such point. For single-variable functions, the
      Extreme Value Theorem told us that a continuous function on a
      closed interval <m>[a, b]</m> always has both an absolute maximum and minimum on
      that interval, and that these absolute extremes must occur at either an endpoint or at a critical point. Thus, to find the absolute maximum and minimum, we determine the
      critical points in the interval and then evaluate the function at these
      critical points and at the endpoints of the interval. A similar approach works for functions of two variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the
      role that closed intervals did for functions of a single variable. A
      closed region is a region that contains its boundary (the unit disk <m>x^2+y^2 \leq 1</m> is closed, while its interior <m>x^2+y^2 \lt  1</m> is not, for example), while a bounded region is
      one that does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for
      functions of a single variable, continuous functions of several
      variables that are defined on closed, bounded regions must have
      absolute maxima and minima in those regions.

      <title>The Extreme Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>f= f(x,y)</m>
      be a continuous function on a closed and bounded region <m>R</m>. Then
      <m>f</m> has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in <m>R</m>.

    <p>
      The absolute extremes must occur at either a critical point in the interior of
      <m>R</m> or at a boundary point of <m>R</m>. We
      therefore must test both possibilities, as we demonstrate in the following example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the temperature <m>T</m> at each point on the
          circular plate <m>x^2+y^2 \leq 1</m> is given by
          <me>
            T(x,y) = 2x^2+y^2-y.

        </p>

        <p>
          The domain <m>R=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2 \leq 1\}</m> is
          a closed and bounded region, as shown on the left of <xref ref="F_10_7_temperature">Figure</xref>, so the Extreme Value Theorem assures us
          that <m>T</m> has an absolute maximum and minimum on the plate. The
          graph of <m>T</m> over its domain <m>R</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_10_7_temperature">Figure</xref>. We will find the hottest and coldest
          points on the plate.

        <p>
          If the absolute maximum or minimum occurs inside the disk, it will be at a critical point so we begin by looking for critical points inside the disk. To do this, notice that critical points are given by the conditions <m>T_x= 4x=0</m> and <m>T_y=2y - 1=0</m>. This means that there is one critical point of the function at the point <m>(x_0,y_0) =(0,1/2)</m>, which lies inside the disk.
        </p>

        <p>
          We now find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary of the
          disk, which is the circle of radius 1. As we have seen, the points on the unit circle can be parametrized as
          <me>
            x(t) = \cos(t), \ y(t) = \sin(t),
          </me>
          where <m>0\leq t \leq 2\pi</m>. The temperature at a point on the circle is then described by
          <me>
            T(x(t), y(t)) = 2\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) - \sin(t).
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary, we look for the critical points of this single-variable function on the interval <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.
          We have
          <md>
            <mrow>
            \frac{dT}{dt} \amp = -4\cos(t)\sin(t) + 2\cos(t)\sin(t) -\cos(t)

        <p>
          This shows that we have critical points when <m>\cos(t) = 0</m> or <m>\sin(t) = -1/2</m>. This occurs when <m>t=\pi/2</m>, <m>3\pi/2</m>, <m>7\pi/6</m>, and <m>11\pi/6</m>. Since we have <m>x(t) = \cos(t)</m> and <m>y(t) = \sin(t)</m>, the corresponding

          So the maximum value of <m>T</m> on the disk <m>x^2+y^2\leq 1</m> is
          <m>\frac{9}{4}</m>, which occurs at the two points <m>\left(\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> on

    <p>
      From this example, we see that we use the following procedure for determining the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed and bounded domain.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Step 1:</title>
          <p>
            Find all critical points of the function in the interior of the domain.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Step 2:</title>
          <p>
            Find all the critical points of the function on the boundary of the domain. Working on the boundary of the domain reduces this part of the problem to one or more single variable optimization problems. Note that there may be endpoints on portions of the boundary that need to be considered. 
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Step 3:</title>
          <p>
            Evaluate the function at each of the points found in Steps 1 and 2.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Step 4:</title>
          <p>
            The maximum value of the function is the largest value obtained in Step 3, and the minimum value of the function is the smallest value obtained in Step 3.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          To find the extrema of a function <m>f=f(x,y)</m>, we first find the
            critical points, which are points where one of the partials of <m>f</m>
            fails to exist, or where <m>f_x = 0</m> and <m>f_y=0</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The Second Derivative Test helps determine whether a critical
            point is a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is defined on a closed and bounded domain, we find
            the absolute maxima and minima by finding the critical points in the
            interior of the domain, finding the critical points on the boundary,
            and testing the value of <m>f</m> at both sets of critical points.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

          <ol marker="a.">
            <li>
              <p>
                We want to determine when <m>f_x(x,y)</m> and
                <m>f_y(x,y)</m> are simultaneously 0.
                Now <m>f_x(x,y) = \cos(x)</m> and <m>f_y(x,y) = -\sin(y)</m> are 0 when
                <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi</m> and <m>y = m \pi</m>,
                where <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> are integers.
                We know that <m>\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi\right)</m> is either 1 or <m>-1</m> depending on whether <m>k</m> is even or odd,
                respectively,
                and <m>\cos(m \pi)</m> is also 1 or <m>-1</m> depending on whether <m>m</m> is even or odd,
                respectively.
                It follows that <m>f\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi,
                m \pi\right)</m> is <m>-2</m>, <m>0</m>, or <m>2</m>.
                So the maximum value of <m>f</m> is 2, which occurs when <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi</m> and
                <m>y = m \pi</m> for <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> even.
                Also, the minimum value of <m>f</m> is <m>-2</m>,
                which occurs when <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi</m> and
                <m>y = m \pi</m> for <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> odd.

                Since <m>F_x</m> and <m>F_y</m> exist everywhere,
                the critical points of <m>F</m> occur when <m>F_x(x,y)</m> and
                <m>F_y(x,y)</m> are simultaneously 0.
                We solve the system
                <md>
                  <mrow>x^2-y-4 \amp = 0</mrow>
                  <mrow>-x + y - 2 \amp = 0</mrow>
                </md>
                by substituting <m>y = x+2</m> into the first equation.
                This leads to the critical points <m>(3,5)</m> and <m>(-2,0)</m>.
                We use the Second Derivative Test to classify these critical points.
                Note that
                <me>
                  F_{xx}(x,y) = 2x, \ F_{yy}(x,y) = 1, \ \text{ and }  \ F_{xy}(x,y) = -1
                </me>.
                Since <m>F_{xx}(3,5)F_{yy}(3,5) - F_{xy}(3,5)^2 = 5 \gt 0</m> and <m>F_{xx}(3,5) = 6 \gt 0</m>,
                it follows that <m>F</m> has a local minimum at <m>(3,5)</m>.
                Also, <m>F_{xx}(-2,0)F_{yy}(-2,0) - F_{xy}(-2,0)^2 = -5 \lt   0</m> tells us that <m>F</m> has a saddle point at <m>(-2,0)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We find the points at which <m>T_x(x,y)</m> and
                <m>T_y(x,y)</m> are simultaneously 0.
                To solve the system
                <md>
                  <mrow>T_x(x,y) \amp = 3y-2xy-y^2 = 0</mrow>
                  <mrow>T_y(x,y) \amp = 3x-x^2-2xy = 0</mrow>
                </md>
                we subtract the second equation from the first leaving us with
                <me>
                  0 = 3y-y^2-3x+x^2 = 3(y-x) - (y-x)(y+x) = (y-x)(3-y-x)
                </me>.
                So either <m>y=x</m> or <m>y=3-x</m>.
                If <m>y=x</m>,
                then the first equation tells us that <m>0 = 3x-3x^2 = 3x(1-x)</m>.
                In this case we have the critical points <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>.
                If <m>y=3-x</m>,
                the second equation tells us that <m>0 = 3x-x^2-2(3-x) = x(x-3)</m>.
                In this case we have critical points <m>(3,0)</m> and <m>(0,3)</m>.
                We use the Second Derivative Test to classify these critical points.

                First we find the critical points of <m>f</m> on the triangular domain.
                The first order partial derivatives of <m>f</m> are
                <me>
                  f_x(x,y) = 2-2x \ \text{ and }  \ f_y(x,y) = 2 - 2y
                </me>.
                So <m>f_x(x,y) = 0</m> and
                <m>f_y(x,y) = 0</m> when <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=1</m>,
                giving us a single critical point <m>(1,1)</m>.
                This point is in the first quadrant and satisfies
                <m>y \lt  9-x</m>, so is in our domain.
                Next we check the boundaries <m>x=0</m> for <m>0 \leq y \leq 9</m>,
                <m>y=0</m> for <m>0 \leq y \leq 9</m>,
                and <m>y=9-x</m> for <m>0 \leq x \leq 9</m>.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>x=0</m> we have <m>f(0,y) = 2+2y-y^2</m>.
                      Since <m>f'(y) = 2-2y</m>,
                      the only critical point of <m>f</m> is <m>(0,1)</m>.
                      The endpoints of this portion of the boundary are <m>(0,0)</m>,
                      and <m>(0,9)</m>, which we also need to check.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>y=0</m> we have <m>f(x,0) = 2+2x-x^2</m>.
                      Since <m>f'(x) = 2-2x</m>,
                      the only critical point of <m>f</m> is <m>(1,0)</m>.
                      The endpoints of this portion of the boundary are <m>(0,0)</m>,
                      and <m>(9,0)</m>, which we also need to check.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>y=9-x</m> we have <m>f(x,9-x) = 2+2x+2(9-x)-x^2-(9-x)^2</m>.
                      Since <m>f'(x) = -2x+2(9-x) = -4x+18</m>,
                      the only critical point of <m>f</m> is
                      <m>(4.5,4.5)</m> The endpoints of this portion of the boundary are <m>(0,0)</m>,
                      and <m>(0,9)</m>, which we also need to check.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Now we test <m>f</m> at the critical points and the appropriate points on the boundary:
                <md>
                  <mrow> f(1,1) = 4, \ f(0,0)=2, \ f(0,9) = -61, \ f(9,0) = -61, </mrow>
                  <mrow> f(0,1) = 3, \ f(1,0)=3, \ \text{ and }  \ f(4.5,4.5) = -20.5 </mrow>
                </md>.
                So the absolute maximum value of <m>f</m> on this domain is 4 and the absolute minimum value is <m>-61</m>.
              </p>  
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This is the same function as in the previous part of the problem,
                so the single critical point of <m>f</m> is <m>(1,1)</m>.
                Now we check the boundary.
                We can parameterize the boundary of the disk by
                <m>x(t) = \cos(t)+1</m> and <m>y(t)=\sin(t)+1</m>.
                On this boundary we have <m>f(\cos(t)+1, \sin(t)+1) = 3</m>.
                Since <m>f(1,1) = 4</m>,
                it follows that the maximum value of <m>f</m> on this disk is 4 and the minimum value is 3.
              </p>

                A point on the plane has coordinates <m>(x,y,6-3x-2y)</m>,
                so the distance from the origin to a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the plane is
                <me>
                  d(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+(6-3x-2y)^2}
                </me>.
                We want to find the minimum value of <m>d</m>.
                Since <m>d</m> cannot be negative,
                the minimum value of <m>d</m> will occur at the same point as the minimum value of <m>f(x,y)=d^2(x,y) = x^2+y^2+(6-3x-2y)^2</m>.
                Now
                <me>
                  f_x(x,y) = 2x-6(6-3x-2y) = 20x+12y-36
                </me>
                and  
                <me>
                  f_y(x,y) =  2y-4(6-3x-2y) = 12x+10y-24
                </me>.
                To solve the system <m>f_x(x,y)=0</m> and <m>f_y(x,y)=0</m>,
                we use elimination to obtain the critical point <m>\left(\frac{9}{7}, \frac{6}{7}\right)</m>.
                Now <m>f_{xx}(x,y)f_{yy}(x,y) - f_{xy}(x,y)^2 = 56 \gt 0</m> and <m>f_{xx}(x,y) = 20 \gt 0</m>,
                so the surface is always concave up.
                This demonstrates that the point
                <m>\left(\frac{9}{7}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{18}{7}\right)</m> is the point on the plane
                <m>z = 6 - 3x - 2y</m> that lies closest to the origin.

            If a continuous function <m>f</m> of a single variable has two critical numbers <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> at which <m>f</m> has relative maximum values, then <m>f</m> must have another critical number <m>c_3</m>, because <q>it is impossible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. The other critical point can be a saddle point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley).</q> (From <em>Calculus in Vector Spaces</em> by Lawrence J. Corwin and Robert H. Szczarb.) Consider the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = 4x^2e^y -2x^4 -e^{4y}</m>. (From Ira Rosenholz in the Problems Section of the <em>Mathematics Magazine</em>, Vol. 60 NO. 1, February 1987.) Show that <m>f</m> has exactly two critical points, and that <m>f</m> has relative maximum values at each of these critical points. Explain how this function <m>f</m> illustrates that it really is possible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by <m>f</m> to see graphically how this happens.

            The critical points for this function <m>f</m> occur when <m>f_x(x,y)</m> and
            <m>f_y(x,y)</m> are simultaneously 0.
            Now
            <me>
              f_x(x,y) = 8xe^y - 8x^3 \ \text{ and }  \ f_y(x,y) = 4x^2e^y-4e^{4y}

          <p>

              <mrow>8xe^y - 8x^3 \amp = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>4x^2e^y-4e^{4y} \amp = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            we multiply both sides of the first equation by
            <m>-\frac{1}{2}x</m> and subtract corresponding sides of the second equation to obtain the equation <m>-4x^4+4e^{4y} = 0</m>.
            This makes <m>x^4 = e^{4y} = (e^y)^4</m> or <m>x = \pm e^y</m>.
            With <m>x^2 = e^{2y}</m>,
            the second equation tells us that
            <m>4e^{3y} - 4e^{4y} = 0</m> or <m>4e^{3y}(1-e^y) = 0</m>.
            This makes <m>1-e^y=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>.
            So our critical points are <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m>.

            If a continuous function <m>f</m> of a single variable has exactly one critical number with a relative maximum at that critical point, then the value of <m>f</m> at that critical point is an absolute maximum. In this exercise we see that the same is not always true for functions of two variables. Let
            <m>f(x,y) = 3xe^y-x^3-e^{3y}</m> (from <q>The Only Critical Point in Town</q> Test by Ira Rosenholz and Lowell Smylie in the <em>Mathematics Magazine</em>, VOL 58 NO 3 May 1985.). Show that <m>f</m> has exactly one critical point, has a relative maximum value at that critical point, but that <m>f</m> has no absolute maximum value. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by <m>f</m> to see graphically how this happens.

          <p>
            A rectangular box with length <m>x</m>, width <m>y</m>, and height <m>z</m> is being built. The box is positioned so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the box lies in the first octant where <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> are all positive. There is an added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit underneath the plane with equation <m>x + 2y + 3z = 6</m>. In fact, we will assume that the corner of the box <q>opposite</q> the origin must actually lie on this plane. The basic problem is to find the maximum volume of the box.

                  Now suppose that we instead stipulated that, while the vertex of the box opposite the origin still had to lie on the plane, we were only going to permit the sides of the box, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, to have values in a specified range (given below).  That is, we now want to find the maximum value of <m>V</m> on the closed, bounded region

                We have already found the critical points of <m>V</m>,

                So the maximum value of <m>V</m> under these conditions occurs on the boundary.

                    <p>
                      When <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m> we have <m>V\left(\frac{1}{2},y\right) = \frac{11}{12}y - \frac{1}{3}y^2</m>.

                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical point <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{11}{8}\right)</m> and the endpoints
                      <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)</m> and <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},2\right)</m>.

                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical point

                      But this value of <m>x</m> is outside of our domain, so we don't consider it.
                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the endpoints <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>.

                      So <m>\frac{dV}{dx} = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{4}{3}x</m> and <m>V</m> has a critical point when <m>x = 1</m>.
                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical point <m>(1,2)</m> and the endpoints <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},2\right)</m> and <m>(1,2)</m>.

                In order to have non-negative values of all variables we must restrict the domain of <m>V</m> to the first octant with <m>z=2-\frac{1}{3}x-\frac{2}{3}y \geq 0</m> or
                <m>0 \leq x \leq 6</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 3-\frac{1}{2}x</m>.
                We have already determined the critical points of <m>V</m>,
                so now it remains to check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical points against the appropriate points on the boundary.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>x=0</m> we have <m>V(x,0) = 0</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>y=0</m> we have <m>V(x,0) = 0</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>y = 3 - \frac{1}{2}x</m> we have <m>V\left(x,3-\frac{1}{2}x\right) = 0</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                So the maximum value of <m>V</m> will occur at one of the critical points found in the previous part of this problem.
                Since <m>V(0,0) = V(6,0) = V(0,3) = 0</m> and <m>V(2,1) = \frac{4}{3}</m>,
                the maximum volume of the box is <m>\frac{4}{3}</m>.
              </p>  
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We have already found the critical points of <m>V</m>,
                and none of them satisfy the restrictions.
                So the maximum value of <m>V</m> under these conditions occurs on the boundary.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m> we have <m>V\left(\frac{1}{2},y\right) = \frac{11}{12}y - \frac{1}{3}y^2</m>.
                      So <m>\frac{dV}{dy} = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{2}{3}y</m> and <m>V</m> has a critical point when <m>y = \frac{11}{8}</m>.
                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical point <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{11}{8}\right)</m> and the endpoints
                      <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)</m> and <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},2\right)</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>x=1</m> we have <m>V(1,y) = \frac{5}{3}y - \frac{2}{3}y^2</m>.
                      So <m>\frac{dV}{dy} = \frac{5}{3} - \frac{4}{3}y</m> and <m>V</m> has a critical point when <m>y = \frac{5}{4}</m>.
                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical point
                      <m>\left(1, \frac{5}{4}\right)</m> and the endpoints <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(1,2)</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>y=1</m> we have <m>V(x,1) = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x^2</m>.
                      So <m>\frac{dV}{dx} = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{2}{3}x</m> and <m>V</m> has a critical point when <m>x = 2</m>.
                      But this value of <m>x</m> is outside of our domain, so we don't consider it.
                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the endpoints <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When <m>y=2</m> we have <m>V(x,2) = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{2}{3}x^2</m>.
                      So <m>\frac{dV}{dx} = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{4}{3}x</m> and <m>V</m> has a critical point when <m>x = 1</m>.
                      So we have check the values of <m>V</m> at the critical point <m>(1,2)</m> and the endpoints <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},2\right)</m> and <m>(1,2)</m>.

                The critical points of <m>V</m> are the points where

                Since <m>V</m> is a polynomial,
                the only critical points will occur when
                <m>V_x(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>V_y(x,y) = 0</m>.
                This gives us the equations

                  <mrow>V_x(x,y) = 45y - 2xy - y^2 \amp = 0</mrow>

                We can factor a <m>y</m> from the first equation and an <m>x</m> from the second to obtain

                  <mrow>x(45-x-2y) \amp = 0</mrow>

                Note that if <m>x=0</m>, <m>y = 0</m>,
                or <m>z = 0</m>, then <m>V = 0</m> and we have a minimum volume.
                So assume <m>x \neq 0</m> and <m>y \neq 0</m>.
                Then we need to solve the system

                  <mrow>45 - 2x - y = 0</mrow>
                  <mrow>45 - x - 2y \amp = 0</mrow>

                Subtracting 2 times the second equation from the first gives
                <me>
                  -45 + 3y = 0
                </me>.
                So <m>y = 15</m>.
                Substituting back into the second equation gives <m>45 - x - 30 = 0</m> or <m>x = 15</m>.

                We need to compare the value of <m>V</m> at the one critical point <m>(15,15)</m> against the values of <m>V</m> on the boundary of the domain.
                The boundary of our domain <m>R</m> consists of the segment <m>B_1</m> between <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(0,45)</m>,
                the segment <m>B_2</m> between <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(45,0)</m>,
                and the segment <m>B_3</m> between <m>(0,45)</m> and <m>(45,0)</m>.
                On <m>B_1</m> we have <m>x=0</m>, and <m>V(0,y)=0</m>.
                On <m>B_2</m> we have <m>y=0</m>, and <m>V(x,0)=0</m>.
                On <m>B_3</m> we have <m>x+y=45</m>,
                so <m>z=0</m> and the volume is also 0.
                So we only get minimum values on the boundary.
                Therefore, the maximum value of <m>V</m> must occur at the point <m>(15,15)</m>.
                Since <m>z = 45-(x+y)</m> we have <m>z=15</m> and so the largest volume is <m>(15)(15)(15) = 3375</m> cubic inches.

              According to <em>The Song of Insects</em> by G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press, 1948) the sound of striped ground crickets chirping, in number of chirps per second, is related to the temperature. So the number of chirps per second could be a predictor of temperature. The data Pierce collected is shown in <xref ref="T-10-7-chirps">Table</xref>., where <m>x</m> is the (average) number of chirps per second and <m>y</m> is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

            <p>
              A scatterplot of the data would show that, while the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is not exactly linear, it looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear, but only approximately linear.

              If we want to use the data to make predications, then we need to fit a curve of some kind to the data. Since the cricket data appears roughly linear, we will fit a linear function <m>f</m> of the form <m>f(x) = mx+b</m> to the data. We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of the squares of the distances between the <m>y</m> values of the data and the corresponding <m>y</m> values of the line defined by <m>f</m>. This type of fit is called a <em>least squares</em> approximation. If the data is represented by the points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>(x_n,y_n)</m>, then the square of the distance between <m>y_i</m> and <m>f(x_i)</m> is <m>(f(x_i)-y_i)^2 = (mx_i+b-y_i)^2</m>. So our goal is to minimize the sum of these squares, of minimize the function <m>S</m> defined by

                  <m>\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = 4200.56</m>,
                  and <m>\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 249.8</m>, so
                  <me>
                    S_{mm}(x,y)S_{bb}(x,y) - S_{mb}(x,y)^2 = 2n\left(\sum_{i=1}^n 2x_i^2\right)- \left(\sum_{i=1}^n 2x_i\right)^2 = 2433.44
                  </me>.
                  Since <m>S_{mm}(m,b) = \sum_{i=1}^n 2x_i^2\gt 0</m>,
                  it follows that this critical point is a local minimum.
                  Note that the discriminant is a constant, as is <m>S_{mm}(m,b)</m>,
                  so the surface defined by <m>S</m> is always concave up,
                  giving us an absolute minimum at this critical point.

                  Using the formula from part (b),
                  we find that <m>m \approx 3.291094089</m> and <m>b \approx 25.2323131</m>,
                  giving us the best fit line
                  <m>y = 3.291094089x + 25.2323131</m>. A plot of this line against the data shows a pretty good linear fit.
