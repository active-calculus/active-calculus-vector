  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S-VVF-Plotting" />, we saw how a vector-valued function of one variable will graphically correspond to a curve in space. While the application of derivatives, integrals, and limits apply to these functions componentwise, we will need to apply our calculus and vector tools <em>together</em> to measure  important properties of these curves. Conceptually, you should think about the parameterization of the curve in space as a description on how to travel through those points in space. Remember that parameterizations are not unique; There is more than one way to walk the same path.

      For example, consider the curve in space that we want a race track as shown in <xref ref="rc-plot1" />. Not every driver will travel along this racetrack in the same way, but every driver has to go through these same points in space (everyone will stay on the track and not take shortcuts). In the vocabulary of this chapter, any parameterization of this curve has to contain the same points, but can possibly go through these <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> coordinates at different times. More generally, some properties you measure will depend on the particular way that a driver goes along the course and some properties will be the same for all drivers (when measured at the same location on the track).

        <p>
          As CEO and Head of Engineering at <em>Steer Clear</em>, you decide that you are almost ready to start testing your self driving car out on the road. Your navigation and telemetry software will use the location tracking system (LTS) to determine all of the important information about how the car is moving and how adjustments need to be made. Before you start programming your software, you decide to drive on quiet, country road and collect data from the LTS to use as test data for your programming. In other words, you will drive on a section of road you already have mapped out in order to check that your software is calculating the correct information. The map in <xref ref="bikepath1" /> below shows the path you plan to take on the country road (with the direction given by the arrows on the plot). Notice that at Points B and F, the road crosses itself to go in a different direction.

      This preview activity highlights the intuitive nature of measuring the direction of travel and the direction of turning given a plot of a curve in space. We will now look at how to use location information in the form of a parameterization of a curve to give precise ways of measuring the direction of travel and the direction of turning at a particular point on the curve. 
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-T">
    <title>Direction of travel</title>
    <p>
      Based on our work in <xref ref="vvf-derivative" />, if <m>\vr(t)</m> is a parameterization of a curve in space, then the velocity vector, <m>\vv(t)=\vr'(t)</m>, is in the direction of travel. Since the speed, <m>\Vert\vv(t)\Vert</m>, is not always 1 (the velocity is not a unit vector), we define the <term>direction of travel</term> as follows.
    </p>
      <definition xml:id="def-T">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The <term>unit tangent vector</term> to a curve is denoted by <m>\vec{T}(t)</m> is computed by 
            <me> \vec{T}(t)=\frac{\vv(t)}{\Vert{\vv(t)}\Vert}</me>
            and measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
    <p>
      From the definition, the unit tangent exists as long as the velocity exists and is not the zero vector. If the velocity vector is <m>\vec{0}</m>, then the object is not moving, thus the direction of travel would not make sense at that instant. If there is a jump or discontinuity in the derivative (<m>\vv</m> does not exist), the direction of travel at that instant does not make sense because there is not a consistent way to define motion. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of <m>\vT</m> allows us to separate the velocity into its magnitude (speed) and direction (unit tangent). Remember that <m>\vT</m> changes along the curve and is calculated as a function of the parameter.  
    </p>
    <example xml:id="helix-T">
      <p>
        For our first example, we will look computing the unit tangent vector of a helix. In particular, we will look at the helix traced out by <m>\vr(t)=\langle \cos(t),\sin(t),\frac{t}{\pi}\rangle </m>.

      <p>
        Based on our parameterization, we have velocity vector given by <m>\vv(t)=\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle </m>, which has speed given by <me>\text{speed}(t) = \Vert\vv(t)\Vert = \sqrt{(-\sin(t))^2+(\cos(t))^2+(\frac{1}{\pi})^2}= \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}</me>
        One of the useful and unique ideas for this example is that we have a constant speed. No matter what parameter value we look at, the speed is always <m> \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}} </m>. Using <xref ref="def-T" />, we can see that 
        <me> \vT(t)= \frac{\vv(t)}{\Vert{\vv(t)}\Vert}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle </me>
        If we look at <m>t=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, then <m>\vT(\frac{\pi}{2})=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle -1,0,\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle</m>. If <m>t=\frac{5\pi}{4}</m>, then <m>\vT(\frac{5\pi}{4})=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle</m>. In <xref ref="helix-plot2" />, <m>\vT(\frac{\pi}{2})</m> is plotted in red and <m>\vT(\frac{5\pi}{4})</m> is plotted in blue. Both of these vectors are unit length and tangent to the curve in the direction of travel for that instant.

    <title>The Direction of Turning</title>
    <p>
      Recalling our analogy of our parameterization describing how someone drives along a racetrack, <m>\vT</m> measures the direction that that a car is heading at any given instant. If we look at <m>t=2</m>, we see that <m>\vT(2)\approx \langle -0.8813, -0.4691, 0.0568 \rangle</m>. This is shown in <xref ref="rc-plot2" />. What direction is the car turning at <m>t=2</m>? You can see by the plot that the car will be be turning left, but that is a relative direction to the car. So how can we measure the direction that the car is turning at this instant, in terms of the locations given by the parameterization in a <m>xyz</m>-coordinate system?

      Let's start looking at <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m>, which will measure how quickly <m>\vec{T}</m> is changing in terms of the parameter. The vector <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m> will measure the change in the direction of travel. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      Remember that vectors have magnitude and direction, so the derivative of a vector valued function of 1 variable will measure the change in the magnitude <em>and</em> change in the direction. Since <m>\vT</m> will always have length 1 (when <m>\vT</m> exists), <em>all</em> of the change in <m>\vT</m> will correspond to a change in direction. So the direction of <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m> will be exactly what we are looking for; namely, <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m> will be in the direction of turning. We don't care (for now) about how fast the car is turning, just what direction that turning is in. So we define the unit normal vector, denoted <m>\vN</m>, as the unit vector in the direction of <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m>.

        Note that the derivative of <m>\vT</m> is easily calculated for all time but this will rarely be the case. Further, making a unit vector in the direction of <m>\vT(t)'=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> will be fairly easy and give us the following calculation:
        <md>
          <mrow> \vec{N}(t) \amp= \frac{\vec{T}'(t)}{\Vert{\vec{T}'(t)}\Vert} </mrow>
          <mrow>            \amp= \frac{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0 \rangle }{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}} </mrow>
          <mrow>            \amp=  \langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0 \rangle </mrow>
        </md> 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can calculate <m>\vN(\frac{\pi}{2})=\langle 0,-1,0 \rangle</m> and <m>\vN(\frac{5\pi}{4})=\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},0 \rangle</m>. If we add these vectors to the plot of the helix with the Unit Tangent Vectors, as in , we can see that the direction of turning (as measured by <m>\vN</m>) is pointing toward the center of the helix. This should make sense the the direction you are turning is toward the inside of the circular trace. Note that the Unit Tangent vector has a vertical component because which corresponds to going <q>up</q> the helix but there is no vertical component to <m>\vN</m>. This is because there is vertical motion, but there is no turning in the vertical direction. The z component of <m>\vT</m> is unchanging so the vertical component of <m>\vT'</m> will be zero.

  As talked about in <xref ref="subsec-T" />, the unit tangent vector, <m>\vT</m>, measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve. The unit normal vector, <m>\vN</m>, measures the direction that an object is turning (in order to stay on the curve). In <xref ref="helix-plot3" />, we saw that the unit tangent and unit normal vectors were orthogonal to each other (when measured at the same point).
</p>
<question>
  <p>
    Can <m>\vN</m> have any part parallel to <m>\vT</m> or must <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> be orthogonal?
  </p>
</question>
<p>
  We will answer this question here with a conceptual, geometric argument. By <xref ref="def-N" />, the unit normal vector is parallel to <m>\vT'=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m>. The derivative of the unit tangent vector will measure the change in <m>\vT</m>, and since <m>\vT</m> is a vector, this will include change in the magnitude and in the direction of <m>\vT</m>. Since the length of <m>\vT</m> does not change, then all of <m>\vT'=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> will be a change in the direction of <m>\vT</m> and not at all in the direction of <m>\vT</m>. This is an intuitive argument for why <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal.
</p>
<p>
  We can also give a more rigorous algebraic argument, but this argument does not provide insight into the measurements or relationship between <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>. For this argument, we will look at the derivative of <m>\Vert \vT \Vert^2</m>. Because the length of <m>\vT</m> is constant, then <m> \frac{d}{dt}\left(\Vert \vT \Vert^2 \right)=0</m>. To simplify <m> \frac{d}{dt}\left(\Vert \vT \Vert^2 \right)</m>, we will use properties of the dot product related to the magnitude, the derivative product rule (across the dot product), then the commutative property of the dot product, respectively.
  <md>
    <mrow> \frac{d}{dt}\left(\Vert \vT \Vert^2 \right) \amp=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\vT \cdot \vT \right)  </mrow>
    <mrow> \amp= \vT' \cdot \vT + \vT \cdot \vT' </mrow>
    <mrow> \amp= 2 \vT \cdot \vT'</mrow>
  </md>
  If <m>2 \vT \cdot \vT' =0</m>, then <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vT'</m> are orthogonal. Since <m>\vN</m> is parallel to <m>\vT'</m>, then <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal.

  <title>The Binormal Vector</title>
  <definition xml:id="def-B">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>Binormal vector</term>, <m>\vec{B}</m>, for a parameterized curve is defined as <me> \vec{B}=\vec{T} \times \vec{N}</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition of <m>\vB</m> creates a three dimensional right handed coordinate system that is relative to the motion along the curve. The Binormal vector will be a unit vector because <m>\Vert \vT \times \vN \Vert = \Vert \vT\Vert \Vert \vN \Vert \sin(\theta)</m> where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>. Since <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are unit vectors and orthogonal to each other, then <m>\Vert \vT\Vert \Vert \vN \Vert \sin(\theta)= 1</m>. The binormal vector, <m>\vB</m>, will give the axis of rotation for the motion along the curve. Note that this measure of rotation follows our right handed measure of rotation. If you put the fingers of your right hand in the direction of travel (<m>\vT</m>) and curl your fingers in the direction of turning (<m>\vN</m>), then your thumb will correspond to the axis of rotation based on how you are moving along the curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    This TNB frame is sometimes called the Frenet frame and is very useful in environments like aviation and space travel because so much of the important flight information needs be in terms of relative measurements to the craft and it's motion.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      In this example, we will complete our calculation of the TNB frame for the helix given by <m>\vr(t)=\langle \cos(t),\sin(t)\frac{t}{\pi}\rangle </m>. From <xref ref="helix-T" /> and <xref ref="helix-N" /> we have the following:
        <md>
          <mrow> \vT(t) \amp= \frac{\vv(t)}{\Vert{\vv(t)}\Vert}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle </mrow>
          <mrow> \vN \amp= \langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0\rangle </mrow>
        </md> 
      Using the definition for <m>\vB</m>, we get 
      <me> \vB = \vT \times \vN = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}} \langle -\frac{1}{\pi}\sin(t), -\frac{1}{\pi}\cos(t), \sin(t)^2+\cos(t)^2 \rangle </me>
      Factoring out <m>\frac{1}{\pi}</m> from each component and simplifying the coefficient gives
      <me> \vB = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2+1}} \langle -\sin(t), -\cos(t), \pi \rangle  </me>

      Note that as you change the <m>t</m>-value and move around the helix, the unit tangent points in the direction of travel, the unit normal points in the direction the object is turning (always to the left while going up the helix), and the Binormal vector is the axis of rotation for the <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> vectors. If you curl the fingers on your right hand from the direction of <m>\vT</m> toward the direction of <m>\vN</m>, notice that your thumb will point in the direction of <m>\vB</m>. This sets up the TNB frame as a right-handed coordinate system that changes with the relative motion of the object.
