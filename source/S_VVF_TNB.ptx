    <introduction>
    <p>
      In first section, we saw how vvf of 1 variable graphically cooresponds to a curve in space. While the derivative, integral, and limits apply to these functions componentwise, we will need to apply our calculus and vector tools together to measure some important properties of these curves. Conceptually, you may want to visualize the parameterization of the curve in space as a way to travel along those points in space. Remember that parameterizations are not unique; There is more than one way to walk the same path.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider the curve in space that we want to study looks like this (show racetrack plot) and is actually a race track. Not every driver will travel along this curve in the same way, but every driver has to go through these same points in space (everyone will stay on the track and not take shortcuts). Some properties you measure will depend on the particular way that a driver goes along the course and some properties will be the same for all drivers (when measured at the same location on the track).

  <subsection>
    <title>Direction of travel</title>
    <p>
      T is the direction of travel. Should make sense from our discussion of the velocity vector that <m>/vv(t)=\vr'(t)</m> is in the direction of travel. Since speed is not 1 we define the direction of travel as follows.
      <definition xml:id="def-">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The unit tangent vector to a curve is denoted by <m>\vec{T}(t)</m> is computed by 
            <me> \vec{T}(t)=\frac{\vv(t)}{\Vert{\vv(t)}\Vert}</me>
            The unit tangent vector measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      The unit tangent exists as long as the velocity exists and is not the zero vector. This should make sense because if there is not motion or there is jump/discontinuity in the derivative, the direction of travel at that instant does not make sense. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition of T has allowed us to separate the velocity into its magnitude (speed) and direction (unit tangent). Remember that T changes along the curve and is calculated as a function of the parameter. 
      
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Example that shows how to calculuate T for a helix. Should make sense of all of these calculations along the way including looking at t=pi/2 and t=5pi/4. Show that you can use the velocity and speed at a single value to calculate for just one t value.

        </statement>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find T at the point P if the tangent line to the curve through P is given by 2-7t, 3t+1,-4t-1

    <p>
      Recalling our analogy of our parameterization describing how we are driving along a racetrack, T measures the direction that that car is heading in at any given moment. Look at t=2 on ounr track, we see that T(2)=  Show a plot with all of this.
      What direction is the car turning at t=2? you can see by the plot that the car will be be turning right/left, but that is a relative direction to the car. So how can we measure the direction that the car is turning at this instant, in terms of the larger coordinate system?
      
    </p>
<p>
  Let's look at <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m>, which will measure how quickly <m>\vec{T}</m> is changing in terms of the parameter. Remember that vectors have magnitude and direction, so the derivative of a vector valued function of 1 variable can measure the change in the magnitude and a change in the direction. Since T will always have length 1 (when T exists), all of the change in T will correspond to a change in direction. So the direction of <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m> will be exactly what we are looking for; namely, <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m> will be in the direction of turning. We don't care (for now) about how fast the car is turning, just what direciton that turning is in. So we define N as the unit vector in the direction of <m>\vec{T}'=\frac{d\vec{T}}{dt}</m>.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-N">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The unit normal vector to a curve is denoted by <m>\vec{N}(t)</m> is computed by 
            <me> \vec{N}(t)=\frac{\vec{T}'(t)}{\Vert{\vec{T}'(t)}}</me>
            The unit norml vector measures the direction of turning along a parameterized curve.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
  When does N exist/not exist?
</p>
<example>
  <p>
    calculate N for the helix example. Make sense of these results at a few points. Note how clean the calculations come out here.
  </p>
</example>
<activity>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In general, calculating N for all times ends up being very difficult because of the nesting of chain rules involved in the definition.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        calculate v, speed, and a for t,t^2,t^3 path
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Now calculate T(t) for the t,t^2,t^3 path
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Now calculate the first component of T'. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
</activity>
<p>
  Remember that to find N, we will need to find the second and third components of T', then divide T' by its magnitude (which will be A LOT)
</p>
<p>
  We have talked about how T measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve and N measures the direction of turning. Can N have any part parallel to T? No. N is parallel to T' and since T does not change length, the derivative of T cannot be parallel to T. All of the change of T has to be a change in direction. Thus T is orthogonal to N
</p>
  </subsection>
<subsection xml:id="subsec-B">
  <title>The Binormal Vector</title>
  <definition xml:id="def-B">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Binormal vector, <m>\vec{B}</m>, for a parameterized curve is defined as <me> \vec{B}=\vec{T} \times \vec{N}</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition of B creates a three dimensional right handed coordinate system that is relative to the motion along the curve. B will be a unit vector because <m>\Vert \vT \times \vN \Vert = \Vert \vT\Vert \Vert \vN \Vert \sin(theta)</m> where theta is the angle between <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>. Since <m>\vT</m> and <m>vN</m> are normal vectors and orthogonal to each other, then <m>\Vert \vT\Vert \Vert \vN \Vert \sin(theta)= 1</m>. B will give the axis of rotation for the motion along the curve. Note that this measure of rotation follows our right handed measure of rotation. If you put the fingers of your right hand in the direction of travel (<m>\vT</m>) and curl your fingers in the direction of turning (<m>\vN</m>), then your thumb will correspond to the axis of rotation based on how you are moving along the curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    This TNB frame is sometimes called the Frenet frame and is very useful in environments like aviation and space travel because so much of the relevent information needs be in terms of relative measurements to the craft and it's motion.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      Compute B for the helix and make sense of the result.

  <title>The Driver or the Road: TNB Frame</title>
  <p>
    In this subsection, we will talk about whether the measurements of T, N, and B will be properties of the driver or the road. A parameterized curve also has a stated orientation (direction of travel). Remember that a measurement involving a parameterized curve is a property of the driver if two different parameterizations can have the different measurements at the same location on the curve. Remember that this does not mean that you look at the same parameter value on the curve, but rather the same location on the curve. A measurement on a parametertized curve is a property of the road if every parameterization of this curve must have the same value(s) for a location on the curve.

          The integration process shows that the length <m>L</m> of a smooth curve defined by <m>\vr(t)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is
          <me>
            L = \int_a^b |\vr'(t)| \, dt.

      <li>
        <p>
          Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We define the curvature <m>\kappa</m> of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or
          <me>
            \kappa = \left\lvert \frac{d\vT}{ds} \right\rvert.

            In this exercise we explore how to find the osculating circle for a given curve. As an example, we will use the curve defined by <m>f(x) = x^2</m>. Recall that this curve can be parameterized by <m>x(t) = t</m> and <m>y(t)=t^2</m>.

                  To find the center of the osculating circle, we will want to find a vector that points from a point on the curve to the center of the circle. Such a vector will be orthogonal to the tangent vector at that point. Recall that <m>\vT(s) = \langle \cos(\phi(s)), \sin(\phi(s)) \rangle</m>, where <m>\phi</m> is the angle the tangent vector to the curve makes with a horizontal vector. Use this fact to show that 
                  <me> \vT \cdot \frac{dT}{ds} = 0.

                  Explain why this tells us that <m>\frac{dT}{ds}</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vT</m>. Let <m>\vN</m> be the unit vector in the direction of <m>\frac{dT}{ds}</m>. The vector <m>\vN</m> is called the <em>principal unit normal vector</em><idx><h>principal unit normal vector</h></idx> and points in the direction toward which the curve is turning.
