	What is the relationship between the circulation of a vector
	field <m>\vF</m> along a simple closed curve <m>C</m> in
	three-dimensional space and the flux integral of
	<m>\curl(\vF)</m> through a surface with <m>C</m> as
	its boundary?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why does the flux integral of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> through a
        surface with boundary only depend on the boundary of the
        surface and not the shape of the surface's interior?

<introduction>
  <p>
    When we studied <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> in <xref ref="S_Vector_GreensTheorem" text="type-global"/>, we saw how
    integrating the circulation density over a region in the plane
    bounded by a simple closed curve gave an alternative way of
    calculating the circulation along the boundary curve. When we
    consider simple closed curves in <m>\R^3</m>, the
    situation gets more complicated. However, there is an interesting,
    and perhaps surprising, generalization of <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> for us to examine.

  <title>Circulation in three dimensions and Stokes' Theorem</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global"/>, we saw
    that a simple closed curve in <m>\R^3</m> can bound many different
    surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface
    <m>S</m> in <m>\R^3</m> that has a well-defined normal vector
    <m>\vn</m> at every point and a boundary curve <m>C</m>. We will
    use the normal vector to define an orientation of <m>C</m> so
    that if a person were to walk along <m>C</m> in the direction of
    the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the
    direction of <m>\vn</m>, their left arm would be over the surface
    <m>S</m>. Notice that this is the same convention that we used
    with <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> if we assume that the
    normal vector being used is <m>\vk</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <xref ref="fig_Vector_StokesThm_surface_boundary" text="type-global"/>, we show the curve <m>C</m> from <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global"/> in magenta as well
    as a surface <m>S</m> that has <m>C</m> as its boundary. The
    chosen normal vector <m>\vn</m> to <m>S</m> is shown, as is
    the orientation of <m>C</m> that matches <m>\vn</m>.

  <p>Thinking back to <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/>, our main
  idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple
  closed curve in <m>\R^2</m> by taking the double integral of the
  circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw
  in <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global"/>, we can break
  up <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> into line integrals around other
  simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented
  oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green's
  Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green's Theorem, we
  require that a simple closed curve <m>C</m> in three
  dimensions bound a smooth surface <m>S</m> with a 
  normal vector <m>\vn</m>. In doing this, we can choose our
  <q>smaller</q> curves similar to the squares we used in Green's
  Theorem to lie on the surface <m>S</m>. This gives us almost all the
  ingredients used in Green's Theorem, but we still need to find a
  suitable replacement for the circulation density.</p>
  
  <p>As we saw in <xref ref="S_Vector_Curl" text="type-global"/>, the
  curl of a vector field in <m>\R^3</m> measures the rotation of the
  vector field. <xref ref="thm_Vector_Curl_rot_strength" text="type-global"/> says that for a unit vector <m>\vv</m>, the
  scalar <m>(\curl(\vF)(a,b,c))\cdot \vv</m> measures the
  rotational strength of <m>\vF</m> at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m> around
  the axis defined by <m>\vv</m>. When <m>\vv</m> is the normal vector
  to the surface <m>S</m> at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m>, we have the
  appropriate analog for the circulation density of <m>\vF</m> on
  <m>S</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Thus, the equivalent idea to integrating
  the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field over a
  region in the plane is calculating the flux integral <m>\iint_D
  \curl(\vF)\cdot (\vr_s\times \vr_t)\, dA</m>, where <m>\vr(s,t)</m>
  on the domain <m>D</m> gives a parametrization of the smooth
  surface <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>A rigorous proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of
  this text. However, the previous subsection and our discussion of
  <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> provide an intuitive
  description of why this theorem is true.</p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Stokes">
    <title>Stokes' Theorem</title>
    <statement>  
      <p>Let <m>S</m> be a smooth surface in <m>\R^3</m> with a simple
      closed curve <m>C</m> as its boundary. Let <m>\vF</m> be a
      vector field that is smooth on <m>S</m> and <m>C</m>. Suppose
      that <m>\vr(s,t)</m> on the domain <m>D</m> gives a
      parametrization of <m>S</m> for which <m>C</m> is oriented so
      that a person walking along <m>C</m> in the direction of its
      orientation and head pointing in the direction of the normal
      vector <m>\vr_s\times \vr_t</m> would have their left hand above
      <m>S</m>. In this setting, the circulation of <m>\vF</m> along
      <m>C</m> is equal to the flux of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> through
      <m>S</m>. That is,
      <me>
	\oint\limits_C \vF\cdot d\vr = \iint\limits_{D} (\curl(\vF))\cdot
	(\vr_s\times\vr_t)\, dA
      </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>When we looked <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/>, it was
  generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we
  calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the
  circumstances described in exercises <xref ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_AreaViaLineInt" text="global"/> and
  <xref ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_centroid" text="global"/>, we
  did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line
  integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector
  field. The situation for <xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title"/> will
  be similar, with the exception of <xref ref="ez_Vector_StokesThm_potential" text="type-local"/> in this
  section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional
  piece of freedom: selecting the surface <m>S</m> through which we
  calculate the flux of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> from amongst possibly
  several reasonable surfaces with boundary <m>C</m>. The next two
  activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their
  boundary.

    In part <xref ref="task_act_Vector_StokesThm_use_circle" text="local">part</xref> of <xref ref="act_Vector_StokesThm_use" text="type-global"/>, there are two <q>reasonable</q> choices for
    the surface bounded by the circle. If you did not do so while
    doing the activity, we encourage you to identify both of them and
    compare which one makes doing the flux integral easier. In
    general, this will vary depending on the (curl of the) vector
    field in question, so we cannot give a rule for determining what
    surface or coordinate system to use. However, we do encourage you
    to think about which surface will make evaluating the flux
    integral easiest.

            <xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title"/> tells us that we
            can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field
            along a simple closed curve in <m>\R^3</m> that bounds a
            surface (with normal vector) on which the vector field is
            also smooth by calculating the flux of the curl of the
	    vector field through the surface.
          </p>

	<li>
          <p>
	  Given two surfaces <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m> with the same
	  boundary <m>C</m> (and assuming normal vectors that give the
	  same orientation on <m>C</m>), the flux of <m>\curl(\vF)</m>
	  through <m>S_1</m> and through <m>S_2</m> is the same
	  because <xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title"/> tells us that
	  this flux is equal to the circulation of <m>\vF</m> along
	  <m>C</m>.</p>
