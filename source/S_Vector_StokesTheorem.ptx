	      What is the relationship between the circulation of a vector field <m>\vF</m> along a simple closed curve <m>C</m> in	three-dimensional space and the flux integral of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> through a surface with <m>C</m> as	its boundary?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why does the flux integral of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> through a surface with boundary only depend on the boundary of the surface and not the shape of the surface's interior?

<introduction>
  <p>
    When we studied <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> in <xref ref="S_Vector_GreensTheorem" text="type-global"/>, we saw how integrating the circulation density over a region in the plane bounded by a simple closed curve is equivalent to calculating the circulation along the boundary curve. When we consider simple closed curves in <m>\R^3</m>, the situation gets more complicated. However, there is an interesting, and perhaps surprising, generalization of <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> for us to examine.

        You should also go back and refamiliarize yourself with our notation for combining paths (as used in line integrals) from <xref ref="path_convention" />. In our convention, <m>Y+M</m> would be closed loop, but <m>Y-M</m> would not make sense because the segment <m>-M</m> does not begin where <m>Y</m> begins.

  <title>Circulation in three dimensions and Stokes' Theorem</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="Stokes_PA_task2" text="phrase-global"/>, we saw that a simple closed curve in <m>\R^3</m> can bound many different surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface <m>S</m> in <m>\R^3</m> that has a well-defined normal vector <m>\vn</m> at every point and a boundary curve <m>C</m>. We will use the normal vector to define an orientation of <m>C</m> so that if a person were to walk along <m>C</m> in the direction of the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the direction of <m>\vn</m>, their left arm would be over the surface <m>S</m>. Notice that this is the same convention that we used with <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> if we assume that the
    normal vector being used is <m>\vk</m>.

    In <xref ref="fig_Vector_StokesThm_surface_boundary" text="type-global"/>, we show the curve <m>C</m> from <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global"/> in magenta as well as a surface <m>S</m> that has <m>C</m> as its boundary. The chosen normal vector <m>\vn</m> to <m>S</m> is shown, as is the orientation of <m>C</m> that matches <m>\vn</m>.

    Thinking back to <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/>, our main idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple closed curve in <m>\R^2</m> by taking the double integral of the circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw in <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" text="type-global"/>, we can break up <m>\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr</m> into line integrals around other simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green's Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green's Theorem, we require that a simple closed curve <m>C</m> in three dimensions bound a smooth surface <m>S</m> with a normal vector <m>\vn</m>. In doing this, we can choose our <q>smaller</q> curves similar to the squares we used in Green's Theorem to lie on the surface <m>S</m>. This gives us almost all the ingredients used in Green's Theorem, but we still need to find a suitable replacement for the circulation density.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As we saw in <xref ref="S_Vector_Curl" text="type-global"/>, the curl of a vector field in <m>\R^3</m> measures the rotation of the vector field. <xref ref="thm_Vector_Curl_rot_strength" text="type-global"/> says that for a unit vector <m>\vv</m>, the scalar <m>(\curl(\vF)(a,b,c))\cdot \vv</m> measures the rotational strength of <m>\vF</m> at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m> around the axis defined by <m>\vv</m>. When <m>\vv</m> is the normal vector to the surface <m>S</m> at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m>, we have the appropriate analog for the circulation density of <m>\vF</m> on <m>S</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Thus, the equivalent idea to integrating the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field over a region in the plane is calculating the flux integral <m>\iint_D \curl(\vF)\cdot (\vr_s\times \vr_t)\, dA</m>, where <m>\vr(s,t)</m> on the domain <m>D</m> that gives a parameterization of the smooth surface <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A rigorous proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of this text. However, <xref ref="Stokes_PA_task1" text="phrase-global"/> and our discussion of <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/> provide an intuitive description of why this theorem is true.

    <title>Verifying and Applying Stokes' Theorem</title>

      In this subsection, we will look at some examples and activities that will verify Stokes' Theorem by calculation both side for a few different situations.

  <example xml:id="verifyStokes">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this example, we will verify Stoke's Theorem for the curve used in <xref ref="PA_Vector_StokesThm" /> using the parameterization and surfaces from <xref ref="Stokes_PA_task2" text="phrase-global" />. We will use the vector field <m>\vF=\langle z-x, y+z, xy \rangle </m> throughout this problem.

    </introduction>
    <task xml:id="verifyStokespart1" >
      <statement>
        <p>
          We first calculate the circulation of <m>\vF=\langle z-x, y+z, xy \rangle </m> around the curve <m>C</m> with parameterization given by <m>\vr(t)= \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \cos(2t)\rangle </m> with <m>0\leq t\leq 2 \pi</m>. Note here that <m>\vr'(t)= \langle -\sin(t), \cos(t), -2 \sin(2t) \rangle </m>. Applying <xref ref="thm_LineIntParam" /> to calculate the circulation, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \int_C \vF \cdot d\vr = \amp \int_0^{2\pi} \langle \cos(2t)-\cos(t),\sin(t)+\cos(2t),\cos(t)\sin(t) \rangle
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp \quad \cdot \langle -\sin(t), \cos(t), -2 \sin(2t) \rangle \, dt
            </mrow>
            </md>
          If you were to write out this dot product and combine like terms, then you would be left with four terms. Each of these can be evaluated using a few trig identities and substitutions. In fact, three of the four terms will correspond to functions that have as much area below the axis as above and thus will have integrals of zero.
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_C \vF \cdot d\vr = \amp \int_0^{2\pi} 2\cos(t)\sin(t) \, dt </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp - \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(2t)\sin(t) \, dt </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp + \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(2t)\cos(t) \, dt </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp - \int_0^{2\pi} 2\cos(t)\sin(t)\sin(2t) \, dt </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 0 -0 + 0 -\pi = -\pi </mrow>
          </md>
          The circulation of <m>\vF</m> around <m>C_3</m> is <m>-\pi</m>. This result being negative means that more of the vector field moves opposite the direction of travel given by the parameterization.

          In this part, we will calculate the flux of <m>\curl(\vF) </m> through a surface with boundary <m>C</m>. As demonstrated by <xref ref="Stokes_PA_task2" text="phrase-global" />, there are several different surfaces that we can use in this problem. For our first case, we will use the part of the surface <m>z=1-2y^2</m> that is bounded by <m>C</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig_stokes_example_12y2" />. This surface can be parameterized by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle s\cos(t),s\sin(t), 1-2 s^2 \sin(t)^2 \rangle </m> with <m>0\leq s\leq 1</m> and <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.

          The next step in setting up the flux integral on the right side of Stokes' Theorem is calculating the curl of <m>\vF</m>. Since <m>\vF=\langle z-x, y+z, xy \rangle </m>, <m>\curl(\vF)=\langle x-1,1-y,0 \rangle </m> and converting to <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> gives <m>\curl(\vF) (s,t)=\langle s\cos(t)-1,1-s\sin(t),0 \rangle </m>. Now we are able to apply <xref ref="thm_flux_int_calc" />, which give the following iterated integral:
          <me>
            \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} \langle s\cos(t)-1,1-s\sin(t),0 \rangle \cdot \langle 0,4s\sin(t), 1 \rangle s \, dt\, ds
          </me>.
          Evaluating this dot product and computing each integral gives 
          <me>
            \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} -4s^3 \sin(t)^2 + 4s^2 \sin(t) \, dt ds = -\pi
          </me>,
          which matches our result for the calculation of the circulation around <m>C</m>.

          As we saw in <xref ref="Stokes_PA_task2" text="phrase-global" /> there is more than one surface that has <m>C</m> as a boundary. We will calculate the flux integral (the right side of Stokes' Theorem) for a different surface to help motivate why it will not matter which surface we use (as long as we have the correct orientation and boundary). For this part we will use the surface <m>z=x^2-y^2</m>, which will be parameterized by <m>\vr(s,t)=\langle s\cos(t),s\sin(t),  s^2 (\cos(t)^2-\sin(t)^2) \rangle </m> with <m>0\leq s\leq 1</m> and <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>. Additionally, we will use the trig identity <m>\cos(2t)=\cos(t)^2-\sin(t)^2 </m> to write the last component of our parameterization as <m>s^2 \cos(2t)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Using our parameterization, we have the following for the partial derivative functions and the corresponding normal vector:

          (There are a number of equivalent algebraic simpmlifications that can be done here by choosing different trigonometric identities.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we are ready to set up the flux integral as the following iterated integral:
          <me>
            \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} \langle s\cos(t)-1,1-s\sin(t),0 \rangle \cdot \langle -2s^2 \cos(t), 2s^2 \sin(t), s \rangle  \, dt\, ds
          </me>
          You probably noticed that this integral looks slightly more complicated than our work in the previous part, but if we are consistent, we should get the same result. Evaluating this dot product and computing each integral gives
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} (-2s^2 \cos(t))(s\cos(t)-1) + (2s^2 \sin(t))(1-s\sin(t)) \, dt\, ds </mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} -2s^3 \cos(t)^2 + 2s^2 \cos(t) + 2s^2 \sin(t) -2s^3\sin(t)^2 \, dt\, ds </mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} -2s^3  + 2s^2 \cos(t) + 2s^2 \sin(t)  \, dt\, ds </mrow>
          </md>.
          Because both sine and cosine will integrate to zero over the interval from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m>, we only need to evaluate 
          <me>2 \pi \int_0^1  -2s^3  \, ds= -\pi</me>,
          which gives exactly the same result as our circulation integral <em>and</em> our flux integral with the other surface.

In general, this will vary depending on the curl of the vector field in question, so we cannot give a rule for determining what surface or coordinate system to use.

    <title>Practice with Surfaces and their Boundaries</title>
  <p>
    When we looked <xref ref="thm_Green" text="title"/>, it was generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the circumstances described in <xref ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_AreaViaLineInt" text="type-local"/> and <xref ref="ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_centroid" text="type-local"/> of <xref ref="S_Vector_GreensTheorem" />, we did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector field. The situation for <xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title"/> will be similar, with the exception of <xref ref="ez_Vector_StokesThm_potential" text="type-local"/> in this section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional piece of freedom: selecting the surface <m>S</m> through which we calculate the flux of <m>\curl(\vF)</m> from amongst possibly several reasonable surfaces with boundary <m>C</m>. The next two activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their boundary.

    This section relies heavily on understanding flux integrals <xref ref="S_Vector_FluxInt" /> as well as the calculation of circulation around a closed curve (from <xref ref="S_Vector_GreensTheorem" /> and <xref ref="S_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral" />).  <xref ref="surfaceboundaries" /> gives some reminders about the different ways to parameterize surfaces, which was first introduced in <xref ref="S-11-6-Parametric-Surfaces-Surface-Area" />.
