  <introduction>
  <p>
    In Section <xref ref="S_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral" />, the idea of a line integral was introduced by looking at the work done by a vector field when traveling along <m>C</m>, a path in space. In particular, the line integral measured the acculumualted amount of the vector field that is in the direction of travel (along the path <m>C</m>). Definition <xref ref="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral" /> shows how to use a Riemann sum to measure the accumulation of the vector field in the direction of travel along the given curve. Additionally, Theorem <xref ref="thm_LineIntParam" /> shows how the line integral <m>\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr </m> can be efficently calculated in terms of the vector field and the derivative of <em>any</em> paramaterization of <m>C</m>. Philosophically, the Riemann sum in Definition <xref ref="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral" /> is adding up the scalar function given by the dot product of the vector field and the unit vector in the direction of travel (along the curve).
  </p>
  <p>
    The following questions ask how much we can generalize the ideas of the previous sections and we will devote the rest of this section answering these as fully as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How could we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a curve in space?
      </li>
      <li>
        What would that accmulation measure?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the most efficent way to calculate this?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This should be the preview activity, I guess. Activity about whether scalar line integrals are positive, negative, or zero based on algebraic function and graphical representation of  curves. should include functions like x+y, y-z, x^2, x^2-y and curves like part of unit circle above the line y=-x. Should also ask user to give a function (non-constant) that will have a zero line integral over the path given by the unit circle above the line y=-x.
  </p>
  <p>
    Activity after the sum of integrals, scalar multiples of integrals, sum of paths statements.
    Activity will have different functions given and use the different properties. possibly have students describe why the various properties must be true in own words.

            <p>
              In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called Copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amoung of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine. The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.

  </introduction>
  <p>
    In Activity <xref ref="PA_ScalarLI" />, you approximated the distance traveled for various paths and multiplied by the density of the Copium on each piece of the path. In contrast to the line integral of a vector field, the calculations of the ore mined does not depend on what direction the path was traveled. We will now use these same ideas to give precise meaning to the measurement of the acculumation of a scalar function's output over a path in space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be a contiunuous function of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> for some open set around <m>C</m>, a curve from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m>. We will begin to approximate the acculumlation of the output of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> by breaking <m>C</m> into pieces with boundary points <m>P=r_0, r_1, ..., r_k-1, r_k=Q</m>. (need to replicate fig_12_2_curve_vec_field.svg without the vector field part of the plot.)
  </p>
  <p>
    We can approximate the accumulation of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> with the following sum:
    <me> \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(r_i^{*}) \Vert{r_{i+1}-r_{i}}\Vert</me>
    where <m>f(r_i^{*})</m> is the output of <m>f</m> for some <m>r_i^{*} \in [r_i,r_{i+1}]</m>. As this sum is made with more pieces and all of the lengths of the pieces goes to zero (i.e. <m>\Vert{r_{i+1}-r_{i}}\Vert \rightarrow 0</m>), we would expect that the sum will approach the actual acculumation of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m>. Notice that it won't matter how we select the point <m>r_i</m> that used in each piece to evaluate the output of <m>f</m> since evaluating the limit as the pieces gets smaller will ensure that the output value will be within a shrinking error from the average value on each piece.
    Evaluating the limit as the size of all of the pieces goes to zero will transform our Riemann sum into an integral that will measure the accumulation of the output of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m>.

    <title>The Line Integral of a Scalar Function</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>f</m> be a contiunuous function of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> for some open set around <m>C</m>, a curve from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> in space. The line integral of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> is defined as
      <me>\int_C f ds =\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(r_i^{*}) \Vert{r_{i+1}-r_{i}}\Vert</me>
      where <m>r_i</m> are points such that <m>P=r_0, r_1, ..., r_k-1, r_k=Q</m> and as <m>k\rightarrow \infty</m> the distance between <m>r_{i-1}</m> and <m>r_i</m> goes to zero.
    </p>
    <p>The integral 
      <me>\int_C f ds </me>
      is called the scalar line integral of <m>f</m> over the curve <m>C</m>.
    </p>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Do we need to talk more about why this limit of ths sum will converge?
  </p>
  <p>
    The notation for a scalar line integral (<m>\int_C f ds </m>) may not immediately make sense. As with the other types of integration we have done (double integrals, line integrals of vector fields, single variable integration, etc.), the subscript of the integral symbol denotes the region of integration. In the case of a scalar line integral, the region of integration is a collection of points given by a curve in space. The function we are integrating is <m>f</m>, a scalar valued funciton (of multiple variables). The differential <m>ds</m> probably looks suspicious to you. If you remember from Section <xref ref="S-9-8-Arc-Length-Curvature" />, <m>s</m> is the arc length of a curve in space. So the differential <m>ds</m> in the scalar line integral notation means that we are adding up the output of <m>f</m> over steps in arc length. This should make sense in terms of how we set up our Riemann sums. We did not set up the pieces of our curve as steps in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>, but rather as steps in arc length (estimated by <m>\Vert{r_{i+1}-r_{i}}\Vert</m>).

<subsection>
  <title>Using Parameterizations to Calculate Scalar Line Integrals</title>
  <p>
    Definition <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> defined <m>\int_C f ds</m> in terms of a limit of a Riemann sum which is usually very useful for understanding what is being measured and not very useful when it comes to efficently calculating the value of a given integral. A scalar line integral is presented algebraically in terms of three variables because the curve is given in terms of points in three coordinates and the function to be integrated is dependent on those same coordinate values. Geometrically, the scalar line integral is a one dimensional problem because we only have one dimension to travel; namely we can travel along the curve (in steps of arc length). Remember that a parameterization of a curve in space is a description of how to travel through the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> points of the curve in terms of a parameter (usually given as <m>t</m>.) Parameterizations are very useful converting the three-variable algebra of a scalar line integral problem into a one dimensional integral.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look at Definition <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> again where we have a parameterization for <m>C</m> given by a vector valued function of one variable <m>r(t)=\langle f(t), g(t), h(t)\rangle</m> for <m>t</m> in some interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Instead of thinking in terms of pieces of the curve <m>C</m>, the parameterization allows us to break the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into pieces <m>a=t_0, t_1, ... ,t_k=b</m> where <m>t_i=a+i(\Delta{t})</m> and <m>\Delta{t}=\frac{b-a}/k</m>. While these pieces will be equally spaced in terms of the parameter <m>t</m>, the corresponding points on the curve <m>C</m> given by <m>r(t_i)</m> will not be equally spaced. We can simplify the notation of our function evaluation as follows:
      <me>f(r_i^{*})=f(r(t_i^{*}))=f(t_i^{*})</me>
    where <m>t_i^{*} \in [t_i,t_{i+1}]</m>. Remember that the parameterization will allow us to write all parts of the scalar line integral as a function of <m>t</m>, so we will simplify <m>\Vert{r_{i+1}-r_i}\Vert</m> as follows:
      <me>\Vert{r_{i+1}-r_i}\Vert =\Vert{r(t_{i+1})-r(t_i)}\Vert= \frac{\Vert{r(t_{i+1})-r(t_i)}\Vert}{\Delta{t}}\Delta{t}</me>
    Applying our parameterization and corresponding points to Definition <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> will give the following
      <me>\int_C f ds =\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(r_i^{*}) \Vert{r_{i+1}-r_{i}}\Vert=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(t_i^{*}) \frac{\Vert{r(t_{i+1})-r(t_i)}\Vert}{\Delta{t}}\Delta{t} </me>
    This is the Riemann Sum of a scalar function of <m>t</m>, specifically <m>f(t) v(t)</m> where <m>v(t)=\frac{d\Vert{r}}{dt}</m> (<m>v(t)</m> is the speed of the parameterization <m>r</m>).
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="scalarlineit_param_thm">
    <title>Calculating Scalar Line Integrals with Parameterizations</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x,y,z)</m> be a continuous multivariable function around a curve in space <m>C</m>, where <m>C</m> has a parameterization given by <m>r(t)</m> for <m>t \in [a,b]</m>.
      <me> \int_C f ds =\int_a^b f(r(t))*\Vert{\frac{dr}{dt}}\Vert dt</me>
    </p>
  </theorem>
  <example xml:id="ScalarLineInt_Example1">
    <p> Let us return to some of the problems from Activity <xref ref="Act_ScalarLI1" />. Specifically, let <m>C_1</m> be part of the unit circle on the <m>xy</m>-plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by <m>y=-x</m>. We will also consider <m>f_1(x,y,z)=y</m>. We can parameterize <m>C_1</m> by <m>r(t)=\langle \cos(t), \sin(t), 0 \rangle</m> with <m>t \in [-\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{3\pi}{4}]</m>. Note here that <m>\Vert{\frac{dr}{dt}}\Vert =\Vert{\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),0\rangle}\Vert=1</m>. We can rewrite the output of <m>f_1</m> along <m>C_1</m> using the parameterization as <m>f_1(x(t),y(t),z(t))=f_1(\cos(t),\sin(t),0)=\sin(t)</m>. Applying Theorem <xref ref="scalarlineit_param_thm" />, we get
      <me> \int_{C_1} f_1 ds = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{3\pi}{4}} \sin(t) (1) dt = -\cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}) - (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}))=\sqrt{2}</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This result should make sense from your earlier explainations of Task <xref ref="Act_ScalarLI1_part2" />. Specifically, we can break the line integral of <m>f_1</m> into three parts according to the following plot.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image source="/fig_ScalarLinInt_Example1.svg" />
      <caption> A subdivided plot of <m>C_1</m></caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The scalar line integal on the blue and the red paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric and the output of <m>f_1</m> will be opposite in sign on the blue and red. This means that <m>\int_{C_1} f_1 ds</m> will be the same as the line integral of <m>f_1=y</m> on the green path. Since the output of <m>f_1</m> is positive on the green path, our result for the scalar line integral should be positive.

    <p> Let <m>C_1</m> be part of the unit circle on the <m>xy</m>-plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by <m>y=-x</m>. We will also consider <m>g(x,y,z)=x-y</m>. We can parameterize <m>C_1</m> by <m>r(t)=\langle \cos(t), \sin(t), 0 \rangle</m> with <m>t \in [-\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{3\pi}{4}]</m>. Note here that <m>\Vert{\frac{dr}{dt}}\Vert =\Vert{\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),0\rangle}\Vert=1</m>. We can rewrite the output of <m>g</m> along <m>C_1</m> using the parameterization as <m>g(x(t),y(t),z(t))=g(\cos(t),\sin(t),0)=\cos(t)-\sin(t)</m>. Applying Theorem <xref ref="scalarlineit_param_thm" />, we get
      <me> \int_{C_1} g ds = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{3\pi}{4}} \cos(t)-\sin(t) (1) dt = \sin(\frac{3\pi}{4})-\cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}) - [\sin(-\frac{\pi}{4})-\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}))]=0</me>

      This result should make sense from your earlier explainations of Task <xref ref="Act_ScalarLI1_part2" />. Specifically, we can break the line integral of <m>f_1</m> into three parts according to the following plot.

    <p>
      The scalar line integal on the blue and the red paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric and the output of <m>g</m> will be opposite in sign on the blue and red. Thus the line integral of <m>g</m> over <m>C_1</m> will be zero.

    Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation. If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m> from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>, we denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m> that follows <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.  Also, if <m>C</m> is an oriented curve, <m>-C</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of definite integrals.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this activity, we will be explaining each of the Proporties from <xref ref="asm_ScalarLineInt_Properties" /> in the context of our Copium mining analogy from <xref ref="PA_ScalarLI" />. Remember that the curve in our scalar line integral cooresponds to the path the mining rig will take and the function in the scalar line integral measures the density of Copium at that point on the surface.

        <answer>
          The scalar line integral <m>\int_C f ds</m> would calculate the accumulation of Copium mined along the path given by <m>C</m> where <m>f</m> gives the density of Copium at each location in the area. In particular, <m>\int_C f ds</m> measures the total Copium mined along the path <m>C</m>.

      We will spend the last part of this section talking about a way to try to visualize the scalar line integral as an area under a curve (in the same way that we visualized 1D integrals.) Let's return to our Copium analogy from <xref ref="PA_ScalarLI" />. In particular, we can look the left side of the mining area.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image source="/images/CopiumDensityPlot.png" />
      <caption> A plot of land with density of Copium deposits </caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In particular, we could visualize the linear density of Copium along the left side of the area using a plot like this. 

      Perhaps use the left side of the copium analogy plot.
      then show a helix with a function that moves vertically
