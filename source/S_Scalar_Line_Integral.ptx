  <introduction>
  <p>
    In 12.2, the idea of a line integral was introduced by looking at the work done by a vector field when traveling along a path C. In particular, the line integral measured the amount of the vector field that is in the direction of travel (along the path C).
  </p>
  <p>
    Theorem 12.3.2 shows how (insert line integral notation here) is calculated by parameterizing C and measures the accumulation of F dot v (where v is the velocity vector along C).

    Question: How could we measure the accumluation of other scalar valued function along curves in space?
  </p>
  <p>
    This should be the preview activity, I guess. Activity about whether scalar line integrals are positive, negative, or zero based on algebraic function and graphical representation of  curves. should include functions like x+y, y-z, x^2, x^2-y and curves like part of unit circle above the line y=-x. Should also ask user to give a function (non-constant) that will have a zero line integral over the path given by the unit circle above the line y=-x.
  </p>
  <p>
    Activity after the sum of integrals, scalar multiples of integrals, sum of paths statements.
    Activity will have different functions given and use the different properties. possibly have students describe why the various properties must be true in own words.

              In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called Copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amoung of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.
              (make a rhombus plot with contours for the copium density)

  </introduction>
  <p>
    In the previous questions, you needed to approximate the distance traveled for various paths and multiply by the density of the ore on each piece of the path. In contrast to the line integral of a vector field, the calculations of the ore mined does not depend on what direction the path was traveled.

    We will now look at how to define and calculate the accumulation of a scalar function for set of inputs given as a curve in space.

    Let f be a function of x,y,z and let C be a curve from P to Q.

    If we break the curve C into peices between points P=r_0, r_1,...r_k-1,r=k=Q, then we can approximate the accumulation of f over C with the following sum

    Sum as i goes from 1 to k f(r_i^*) ||r_i-r_{i-1}|| will be approximation to accumulation of f over the curve C, where r_i* is some point on the curve C between r_i and r_{i-1}

    This Riemann sum will become a better approximation of the actual accumulation of f over C as the pieces of the curve become smaller. The limit as the size of all of the pieces goes to zero will transform our Riemann sum into an integral that will measure the accumulation of the output of f over C. 

    State Definition of scalar line integral here. 
    Use the int f ds notation here.


  </p>

  <p>
  Talk about how the int f ds notation is telling you that the integral is the sum of the output of f over steps in s, the arc length. (reference to section 9.8.2)
