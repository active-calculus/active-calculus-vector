  <introduction>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="S_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral" />, the idea of a line integral was introduced by looking at the work done by a vector field when traveling along <m>C</m>, a path in space. In particular, the line integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is along the path <m>C</m> (in the direction of travel.) <xref ref="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral" /> shows how to use a Riemann sum to measure the accumulation of the vector field in the direction of travel along the given curve. Additionally, <xref ref="thm_LineIntParam" /> shows how the line integral <m>\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr </m> can be efficently calculated in terms of the vector field and the derivative of <em>any</em> paramaterization of <m>C</m>. Philosophically, the Riemann sum in <xref ref="def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral" /> is adding up the scalar function given by the dot product of the vector field and the unit vector in the direction of travel (along the curve).
  </p>
  <p>
    We will devote the rest of this section to answering these questions about generalizing the ideas of line integrals as fully as possible.

        In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called Copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amoung of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine. The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.

<subsection>
  <title>Defining line integrals of scalar functions</title>
<p>
  In <xref ref="PA_ScalarLI" />, you approximated the distance traveled for various paths and multiplied by the density of the Copium on each piece of the path. In contrast to the line integral of a vector field, the calculations of the ore mined does not depend on what direction the path was traveled. We will now use these same ideas to give precise meaning to the measurement of the acculumation of a scalar function's output over a path in space.
</p>
<p>
  Let <m>f</m> be a contiunuous function of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> for some open set around <m>C</m>, a curve from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m>. We will begin to approximate the acculumlation of the output of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> by breaking <m>C</m> into pieces with boundary points <m>P=r_0, r_1, ..., r_n-1, r_n=Q</m>. The curve <m>C_i</m> is the part of <m>C</m> that goes from <m>\vr_{i-1}</m> to <m>\vr_i</m> and <m>\Delta \vr_i</m> is the displacement vector from <m>\vr_{i-1}</m> to <m>\vr_i</m>
</p>
<figure>
  <caption>A curve in space with segments given by <m>\mathbf{r}_i</m></caption>
  <image source="/scalar_line_int_segments"/>
</figure>
<p>
  We can approximate the accumulation of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> with the following sum:
  <me> \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(r_i^*) \Vert{r_{i}-r_{i-1}}\Vert</me>
  where <m>f(r_i^{*})</m> is the output of <m>f</m> for some <m>r_i^{*} \in C_i</m>. As this sum uses more pieces and all of the lengths of the pieces goes to zero (i.e. <m>\Vert{\Delta \vr_i}\Vert \rightarrow 0</m>), we would expect that the sum will approach the actual acculumation of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m>. Notice that it won't matter how we select the point <m>r_i^*</m> that is used in each piece to evaluate the output of <m>f</m> since evaluating the limit as the length of <m>C_i</m> gets smaller will ensure that the output value choosen will be within a shrinking error from the average value on each piece. Evaluating the limit of the sum above as the size of all of the pieces goes to zero will transform our Riemann sum into an integral that will measure the accumulation of the output of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m>.

  <title>The Line Integral of a Scalar Function</title>
  <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be a contiunuous function of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> for some open set around <m>C</m>, a curve from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> in space. The line integral of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> is defined as
    <me>\int_C f ds =\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(r_i^{*}) \Vert{r_{i}-r_{i-1}}\Vert</me>
    where <m>r_i</m> are points such that <m>P=r_0, r_1, ..., r_n-1, r_n=Q</m> and as <m>n\rightarrow \infty</m> the distance between <m>r_{i-1}</m> and <m>r_i</m> goes to zero.
  </p>
  <p>The integral
    <me>\int_C f \enspace ds </me>
    is called the scalar line integral of <m>f</m> over the curve <m>C</m>.
  </p>
</definition>
<p>
  The notation for a scalar line integral (<m>\int_C f \enspace ds </m>) may not immediately make sense. As with the other types of integration we have done (double integrals, line integrals of vector fields, single variable integration, etc.), the subscript of the integral symbol denotes the region of integration. In the case of a scalar line integral, the region of integration is a collection of points given by a curve in space. The function we are integrating is <m>f</m>, a scalar-valued functiton of multiple variables. The differential <m>ds</m> probably looks suspicious to you. If you remember from <xref ref="S-9-8-Arc-Length-Curvature" />, <m>s</m> is the arc length of a curve in space. So the differential <m>ds</m> in the scalar line integral notation means that we are adding up the output of <m>f</m> over steps in arc length. This should make sense in terms of how we set up our Riemann sums. We did not set up the pieces of our curve as steps in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>, but rather as steps in arc length (estimated by <m>\Vert{r_{i+1}-r_{i}}\Vert</m>).
</p>
<example xml:id="sli_pm" >
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this example we will make arguments about the line integral of the following scalar functions will be positive, negative, or zero. For all of this example, we will use the curve <m>C</m> given by <m>y=x^2</m> for <m>x \in [-1,2]</m>.
      <ul>
        <li><m>f(x,y)=x</m></li>
        <li><m>g(x,y)=-y</m></li>
        <li><m>h(x,y)=y-x^2</m></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_sli_pm1">
      <caption>The curve <m>C</m> used in the line integral for <xref ref="sli_pm" /></caption>
      <image source="/fig_scalarlineint_pmexample1"/>
    </figure>
  </introduction>
  <task xml:id="task1_sli_pm">
    <p>
      For our first case, we will consider the line integral <me> \int_C f \enspace ds </me>. Remember that the line integral of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> will measure the accumulation of the output of <m>f</m> over the points on the curve <m>C</m>. <xref ref="fig_sli_pm3"/> shows that the blue branch of the curve <m>C</m> will have positive output and the red part will have negative output for <m>f</m>. Intuitively, there is more of the curve with positive <m>f</m> outputs than negative <m>f</m> outputs, so we would expect <m>\int_C f \enspace ds</m> to be positive.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_sli_pm3">
      <caption>The curve <m>C</m> split into regions with positive (blue) and negative (red) outputs of <m>f</m></caption>
      <image source="/fig_scalarlineint_pmexample3" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      If we break our region <m>C</m> into three pieces as shown in <xref ref="fig_sli_pm2" />, we can make a rigourous argument about why the result of <m>\int_C f \enspace ds</m> will be positive. We will call the red, green, and blue sections of <xref ref="fig_sli_pm2" /> <m>C_1</m>, <m>C_2</m>, and <m>C_3</m> respectively. So in the notation of <xref ref="asm_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_Properties" text="title"/>, <m>C = C_1+C_2+C_3</m>. No matter how we break up the curve <m>C_1</m> to set up a Riemann sum used in <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> we can do the symmetric version on curve <m>C_2</m>. The only difference between the Riemann sums and thier associated line integrals for <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> will be the sign on the output of <m>f</m>. This means that <me> \int_{C_1} f \enspace ds = -\int_{C_2} f \enspace ds</me> and thus
      <md>
        <mrow> \int_C f \enspace ds = \int_{C_1} f \enspace ds + \int_{C_2} f \enspace ds +\int_{C_3} f \enspace ds </mrow>
        <mrow>=-\int_{C_2} f \enspace ds + \int_{C_2} f \enspace ds +\int_{C_3} f \enspace ds = \int_{C_3} f \enspace ds 
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_sli_pm2">
      <caption>The curve <m>C</m> split into three regions with positive (blue and green) and negative (red) outputs of <m>f</m></caption>
      <image source="/fig_scalarlineint_pmexample2" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The argument for why <m>\int_{C_1} f \enspace ds = -\int_{C_2} f \enspace ds</m> requires that both the points on the curves <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> and the output of <m>f</m> on those parts is symmetric. In <xref ref="sli_caution" /> you will see examples where having only one part of this symmetry is not sufficent to make this type of argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have shown that <m>\int_C f \enspace ds =  \int_{C_3} f \enspace ds </m> and want to demonstrate why <m>\int_{C_3} f \enspace ds </m> will be positive. Because the output of <m>f</m> is positive for all of the points on the curve <m>C_3</m>, all elements of the associated Riemann sum in <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> will be positive (the length of the displacement vectors and corresponding arc lengths are always positive). Thus <m>\int_C f \enspace ds =  int_{C_3} f \enspace ds \gt 0</m>. This argument would work well for any curve that was only in the first and second octants because the outpuf of <m>g</m> for all of those points would be negative.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      We now want to consider whether <m>\int_C g \enspace ds </m> will be positive, negative, or zero. This is a simpler argument than in the previous case because the output of <m>g</m> will be negative for all points in <m>C</m> (execept for the origin). Each term in the Riemann sum used to define the scalar line integral will be the product of a negative value (<m>g(r_i^{*})</m>) and a positive value (<m> \Vert{r_{i}-r_{i-1}}\Vert</m>). Therefore the Riemann sums will be negative and the limit as you take more terms in this sum will also be negative. Thus, <m>\int_C g \enspace ds \lt 0</m>.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      For our last case we want to make an argument whether <m> \int_C h \enspace ds</m> will be positive, negative, or zero. While we cannot lean on the intuitive nature of the where coordinates are positive or negative, we can make a very precise argument about the output of <m>h</m> for the points on <m>C</m>. While <m>g(x,y)=y-x^2</m> will have a range that includes all real numbers, the output of <m>g</m> is <alert>always</alert> zero for the points on our curve <m>C</m> because for points on <m>C</m>, the <m>y</m>-coordinate is equal to the <m>x</m>-coordinate squared. This means that no matter how we break up our segments for the Riemann sum, the <m>h(r_i^{*})</m> terms will always be zero. No matter how many terms are used the Reimann sum will be zero, and the limit of the Riemann sums will also be zero. Thus, <m> \int_C h \enspace ds=0</m>.

  <title>Using Parameterizations to Calculate Scalar Line Integrals</title>
  <p>
    <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> defined <m>\int_C f \enspace ds</m> in terms of a limit of a Riemann sum which is usually very useful for understanding what is being measured and not very useful when it comes to efficiently calculating the value of a given integral. A scalar line integral is presented algebraically in terms of three variables because the curve is given in terms of points in three coordinates and the function to be integrated is dependent on those same coordinate values. Geometrically, the scalar line integral is a one dimensional problem because we only have one dimension to travel; namely we can travel along the curve (in steps of arc length). Remember that a parameterization of a curve in space is a description of how to travel through the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> points of the curve in terms of a parameter (usually given as <m>t</m>.) Parameterizations are very useful converting the three-variable algebra of a scalar line integral problem into a one dimensional integral.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look at applying a parameterization for <m>C</m> (given by a vector valued function of one variable <m>r(t)=\langle f(t), g(t), h(t)\rangle</m> for <m>t</m> in some interval <m>[a,b]</m>) to <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" />. Instead of thinking in terms of pieces of the curve <m>C</m>, the parameterization allows us to break the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into pieces <m>a=t_0, t_1, ... ,t_n=b</m> where <m>t_i=a+i(\Delta{t})</m> and <m>\Delta{t}=\frac{b-a}{k}</m>. While these pieces will be equally spaced in terms of the parameter <m>t</m>, the corresponding points on the curve <m>C</m> given by <m>r(t_i)</m> will not be equally spaced.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="scalar_int_param_seg">
      <caption>The curve <m>C</m> split into segments defined by equally spaced parameter values</caption>
      <image source="/scalar_line_int_segments_param" />
    </figure>
  <p>
    We can simplify the notation of our function evaluation as follows:
      <me>f(r_i^{*})=f(r(t_i^{*}))=f(t_i^{*})</me>
    where <m>t_i^{*} \in [t_i,t_{i+1}]</m>. Remember that the parameterization will allow us to write all parts of the scalar line integral as a function of <m>t</m>, so we will simplify <m>\Vert{r_{i+1}-r_i}\Vert</m> as follows:
      <me>\Vert{r_{i}-r_{i-1}}\Vert =\Vert{r(t_{i})-r(t_{i-1})}\Vert= \frac{\Vert{r(t_{i})-r(t_{i-1})}\Vert}{\Delta{t}}\Delta{t}</me>
    Applying our parameterization and corresponding points to Definition <xref ref="ScalarLineIntegral_def" /> will give the following
      <me>\int_C f \enspace ds =\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(r_i^{*}) \Vert{r_{i}-r_{i-1}}\Vert=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i^{*}) \frac{\Vert{r(t_{i-1}+\Delta t)-r(t_{i-1})}\Vert}{\Delta{t}}\Delta{t} </me>
    This is the Riemann Sum of a scalar function of <m>t</m>, specifically <m>f(t) v(t)</m> where <m>v(t)=\frac{d\Vert{r}\Vert}{dt}</m> (<m>v(t)</m> is the speed of the parameterization <m>r</m>).

      For our last example, we will compute the scalar line integral

      The function we are integrating in this example gives an output of the x-coordinates of the points on the curve. So we are adding up the <m>x</m>-values of the points on <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>, but since the <m>x</m>-coordinates on <m>C_1</m> go from -1 to 0 and the <m>x</m>-coordinates on <m>C_2</m> go from 0 to 1, you may argue that the values of <m>\int_{C_1} x \enspace ds </m> and <m>\int_{C_2} x \enspace ds </m> will cancel out to zero. This is not correct though because the scalar line integrals are not just adding up the output of our scalar function. The Riemann sum used in the scalar line integral is adding up the product of the scalar function's output multiplied by the displacement of the segment used. Because the displacement used in <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> will not be symmetric, we cannot make the geometric cancelation argument as in <xref ref="task1_sli_pm" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use <xref ref="scalarlineit_param_thm" /> to evaluate our line integral. We parameterize <m>C_1</m> with
      <m>\vr_1(t)= \langle -1=t,2-2t\rangle</m> and parameterize <m>C_2</m> with <m> \vr_2(t) =\langle t,t\rangle </m>. Both parameterizations use parameter values in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>. We can calculate <m>\Vert{\vr_1}\Vert = \sqrt{5}</m> and <m>\Vert{\vr_2}\Vert = \sqrt{2}</m>. Thus we can evaluate our scalar line integral as
      <md>
        <mrow>\int_{C_1+C_2} x \enspace ds = \int_{C_1} x \enspace ds +\int_{C_2} x \enspace ds</mrow>
        <mrow>\quad = \int_0^1 (-1+t) \sqrt{5} \enspace dt + \int_0^1 (t) \sqrt{2} \enspace dt</mrow>
        <mrow> \quat = -\sqrt{5}+\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \neq 0 </mrow>
      </md>
      In the calculation above, you can see how the difference in displacements manifests differently in the two integrals (as <m>\sqrt{5}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2}</m>) which makes the final result not quite cancel out to zero.

  <title>Properties of Scalar Line Integrals</title>
  <p>
     Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation from <xref ref="asm_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_Properties" text="title" />. If <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are oriented curves, with <m>C_1</m> from a point <m>P</m> to a point <m>Q</m> and <m>C_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to a point <m>R</m>, we denote by <m>C_1+C_2</m> the oriented curve from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m> that follows <m>C_1</m> to <m>Q</m> and then continues along <m>C_2</m> to <m>R</m>.  Also, if <m>C</m> is an oriented curve, <m>-C</m> denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar in definite integrals.

          For a constant scalar <m>k</m>, scalar valued functions<m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, and oriented curves <m>C</m>, <m>C_1</m>, and <m>C_2</m>, the following properties hold:

  The biggest difference bewteen <xref ref="asm_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_Properties" text="title" /> and <xref ref="asm_ScalarLineInt_Properties" text="title" /> is part c.

  <title>Visualizations of Scalar Line Integrals as Area Under a Curve</title>
<p>
  We will spend the last part of this section talking about a way to try to visualize the scalar line integral as an area under a curve (in the same way that we visualized 1D integrals.) Let's return to our Copium analogy from <xref ref="PA_ScalarLI" />. In particular, we can look the left side of the mining area.
</p>
<figure>
  <caption>A plot of land with density of Copium deposits </caption>
  <image source="/CopiumMinePlot" />
</figure>
<p>
  In particular, we could visualize the linear density of Copium
  along the left side of the area using a plot like Figure <xref
  ref="LeftSideofCopiumMine" />.
</p>
<figure xml:id="LeftSideofCopiumMine">
  <caption> A plot of the Copium density on the left side of the
  mine shown above </caption>
  <image source="/leftsideplot" />
</figure>
<p>
  In <xref ref="LeftSideofCopiumMine" />, the horizontal axis gives the distance traveled along the left side of <xref ref="CopiumPlot" />. Because this is a stright path, we could plot the density above the path of the Copium mining plot. In fact, we could plot the density above the plot for all of the sides of the mining plot.
