    <introduction>
      <p>
        We now have a way to measure direction of travel and direction of turning. speed will give us an idea about how fast we are moving along the curve, but we don't have a way to measure how much turning is happening at a given location. In this section, we will try to measure how quickly a path is turning

          Draw curve with flat and tight curve. Draw T at P1 and Q1. Now draw T at P2 and Q2. Note that P1 and P2 are separated by the same amount of arc length as Q1 and Q2. Based on your T vectors, do youthink the direction of travel is changing faster at P or Q. Explain your ideas.

      <p>
        define curvature as the change in T in terms of steps in arc length

      Given a space curve, there are two natural
      geometric questions one might ask: how long is the curve and how much
      does it bend? In this section, we answer both questions by
      developing techniques for measuring the length of a space
      curve as well as its curvature.
    </p>
</introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Curvature</title>
    <p>
      For a smooth space curve, the <em>curvature</em> measures how fast the
      curve is bending or changing direction at a given point. For example,
      we expect that a line should have zero curvature everywhere, while a
      circle (which is bending the same at every point) should have constant
      curvature. Circles with larger radii should have smaller curvatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of the curve at a point. We may do this using a continuously varying tangent vector to the curve, as shown at left in <xref ref="F_9_8_Curvature_1_a">Figure</xref>. The direction of the curve is then determined by the angle <m>\phi</m> each tangent vector makes with a horizontal vector, as shown at right in <xref ref="F_9_8_Curvature_1_a">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    
    <figure xml:id="F_9_8_Curvature_1_a">
      <caption>Left: Tangent vectors to an ellipse. Right: Angles of tangent vectors. </caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
        <image source="images/fig_9_8_tangents"/>
        <image source="images/fig_9_8_tangents_angles"/>
        </sidebyside>
    </figure>
    

    <p>
      Informally speaking, the curvature will be
      the rate at which the angle <m>\phi</m> is changing as we move along the
      curve. Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move
      along the curve; if we move with a greater speed along the curve,
      then <m>\phi</m> will change more rapidly. This is why the speed limit is
      sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words,
      the rate of change of <m>\phi</m> will depend on the parametrization we use
      to describe the space curve. To eliminate this dependence on the
      parametrization, we choose to work with an arc
      length parametrization <m>\vr(s)</m>, which means we move along the curve
      with unit speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using an arc length parametrization <m>\vr(s)</m>, we define the tangent vector
      <m>\vT(s) = \vr'(s)</m>, and note that <m>|\vT(s)| = 1</m>; that is, <m>\vT(s)</m> is
      a unit tangent vector. We then have <m>\vT(s) = \langle \cos (\phi(s)),
      \sin(\phi(s)) \rangle</m>,
      which means that
      <me>
        \frac{d\vT}{ds} = \left\langle -\sin(\phi(s)) \frac{d\phi}{ds}, ~
        \cos(\phi(s)) \frac{d\phi}{ds} \right\rangle = 
        \langle -\sin(\phi(s)),~
        \cos(\phi(s)) \rangle \frac{d\phi}{ds}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore
      <me>
        \left|\frac{d\vT}{ds}\right| =  \left|\langle -\sin(\phi(s)),~
        \cos(\phi(s)) \rangle\right| ~\left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right| = 
        \left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right|
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This observation leads us to adopt the following definition. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>C</m> is a smooth space curve and
          <m>s</m> is an arc length parameter for <m>C</m>, then the <term>curvature</term><idx><h>curvature</h></idx>, <m>\kappa</m>, of <m>C</m> is
          <me>
            \kappa = \kappa(s) = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>Note that <m>\kappa</m> is the Greek lowercase letter <q>kappa</q>.

    <ol marker="a.">
      <li>
      <p>
          We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0
          everywhere. To show that our definition of curvature measures this
          correctly in 2-space, recall that
          <xref ref="A_9_8_1"/> gives us the arc
          length parameterization
          <me>
            x(s) = x_0+\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}s \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \
              y(s) = y_0+\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}s
          </me>
          of a line. Use this information to explain why the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere. 
        </p>

      </li>

      <li>
      <p>
        Recall that an arc length
        parameterization of a circle in 2-space of radius <m>a</m> centered at
        the origin is, from
        <xref ref="A_9_8_1"/>,
        <me>
          \vr(s) = \left\langle a \cos\left(\frac{s}{a}\right),~
              a \sin\left(\frac{s}{a}\right)\right\rangle.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Show that the curvature
        of this circle is the constant <m>\frac{1}{a}</m>. What can you say about the relationship between the size of the radius of a circle and the value of its curvature? Why does this make sense?
      </p>
      </li>
     </ol> 
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We have
          <me>
            \vT(s) = \left\langle -\sin\left(\frac{s}{a}\right), \cos\left(\frac{s}{a}\right) \right\rangle
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the curvature of a circle of radius <m>a</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\kappa \amp = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \left\lvert \left\langle -\frac{1}{a}\cos\left(\frac{s}{a}\right), -\frac{1}{a}\sin\left(\frac{s}{a}\right) \right\rangle \right\rvert</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{a}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, as expected, larger circles have smaller curvature.
        </p>
      </solution>
      
    </activity>

    <p>
      The definition of curvature relies on our
      ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length. Since we have
      seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we
      would like to be able to express the curvature in terms of a more
      general parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin, we need to describe the vector <m>\vT</m>, which is
      a vector tangent to the curve having unit length. Of course, the
      velocity vector <m>\vr'(t)</m> is tangent to the curve; we simply need to
      normalize its length to be one. This means that we may take
      <men xml:id="eq_9_8_unit_tangent">
        \vT(t) = \frac{\vr'(t)}{|\vr'(t)|}.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the curvature of the curve defined by <m>\vr</m> is
      <md>
        <mrow>\kappa \amp = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{dt} \frac{dt}{ds} \right\rvert</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{\left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{dt} \right\rvert}{ \left\lvert \frac{ds}{dt} \right\rvert }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{\left\lvert \vT'(t) \right\rvert}{ \left\lvert \vr'(t) \right\rvert}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to
      calculate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given
      below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.

              If we assume that <m>0 \lt  b \lt  a</m>,

              (when <m>t = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>).
              The denominator of our curvature function can be written as

              These <m>t</m> values correspond to the points <m>(\pm a, 0)</m>.
              Similarly, the curvature of the ellipse is smallest when the denominator is largest,

              These <m>t</m> values correspond to the points <m>(0, \pm b)</m> as expected.

      The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the curve at that point. The curvature at a point on a curve describes the <em>circle</em> that best approximates the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius <m>a</m> has curvature <m>1/a</m>, then the
      circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose curvature is <m>\kappa</m> has radius <m>1/\kappa</m> and will be tangent to the tangent line at that point and has its center on the concave side of the curve. This circle, called the <em>osculating circle</em> of the curve at the point, is shown in <xref ref="F_9_8_osculating">Figure</xref> for a portion of a parabola.
