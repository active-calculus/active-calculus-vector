  <introduction>

      Vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors
      (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>. The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. In <xref ref="vvf1_def" /> a curve is traced by the terminal point of <m>\vr(t)</m>, a function that has a real number as an input and produces a vector in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>. In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take a point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> (or a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> in <m>\R^3</m>) as an input and produce a vector (typically in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>, respectively) as output.

      <introduction>
        <p>
        It's common when discussing weather to talk about the wind <term>speed</term>, but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo"/><per base="hour" /></quantity> without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing.
        If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. For instance, if you are taking off in a hot air balloon, the wind direction will determine which direction the chase team should start going to keep track of you.
        Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind <term>velocity</term> at each point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).

        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose that given a point <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane, you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector <m>\langle y,x\rangle</m>. For example, we'd then know that at the point <m>(1,-1)</m>, the wind velocity is <m>\langle -1,1\rangle</m>. We will give the wind velocity as a function <m>\vF</m>, where <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle</m>. In the table below, fill in the wind velocity vectors for the given points.

              A table of values of these vector-valued functions is useful to understand the input vs. output nature of a vector field as a function, but perhaps even better is a method of visualizing the vector outputs. A good picture is worth a thousand words (or numbers). Returning to our analogy of the output vector for our vector field being wind velocity, if <m>\vF(2,1) = \langle 1,2\rangle</m>, this means that at the location <m>(2,1)</m> the wind is moving in the direction given by <m>\langle 1,2\rangle</m>. Thus, we draw the output vector <m>\langle 1,2\rangle</m> with its initial point at <m>(2,1)</m>.

We denote such a vector field by <m>\vF(x,y)</m> or <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m>, where the vector associated to the point <m>(x,y)</m> or <m>(x,y,z)</m> is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_FluidVelocity" /> shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.

          Green vectors representing the velocity vectors of a flowing fluid. The vectors along the vertical axis of syymmetry are directed from bottom to top and are longest in the middle. Vectors on either side of the vertical axis of symmetry form circular rotation patterns, clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. In the upper left corner, there is an inset figure that enlarges the center of rotation on the left side of the image.

    <p>
      Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects which is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth. The magnitude of the force vector is determined by the distance between the object and the earth (by an reciprocal squared relationship.) An illustration of this vector field can be seen in <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_gravity" />, where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at larger distances from the origin (Earth).

    <p>
      As suggested in the introduction and <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" />, vector fields can be specified using the notation of functions and vectors.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="vf_def">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector field</term><idx><h>vectorfield</h><h>definition</h></idx> in <m>2</m>-space is function whose value at a point <m>(x,y)</m> is a <m>2</m>-dimensional vector <m>\vF(x,y)</m>.  Similarly, in <m>3</m>-space, a vector field is a function <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> whose value at the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> is a <m>3</m>-dimensional vector.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Since <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> is a vector, it has <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m> components. Each of these components is a scalar function of the point <m>(x,y,z)</m>, and so we will often write
      <me>
        \vF(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if <m>\vF(x,y,z) = \langle x^2,xy\sin(z),y^3\rangle</m>, then the component functions of <m>\vF</m> would be <m>F_1(x,y,z) = x^2</m>, <m>F_2(x,y,z) = xy\sin(z)</m>, and <m>F_3(x,y,z) = y^3</m>. Any time we are considering a vector field <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m>, the definitions of functions <m>F_1</m>, <m>F_2</m>, and <m>F_3</m> should be inferred in this manner. (For a vector field <m>\vF(x,y)</m> in <m>2</m>-space, we only have the functions <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m>, which are defined analogously.)

    <title>Plotting Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" /> gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle</m> and <m>\vG(x,y) = \langle 0,-x\rangle</m>. It would be impossible to sketch <em>all</em> of
      the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computers can do a great job of making such sketches.  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors in computer plots are typically scaled, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in this text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj</m> in <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_scalefield" />.

The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform rescaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vector's direction is completely accurate,
      but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the <em>relative</em> magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.

      In the previous activity, we looked a special type of curve in a vector field, namely the curve that flows with the output of the vector field. Geometrically, the output vectors of the vector field will be tangent to the flow curves. These flow curves come up in several physical situations, including as solution curves to a system of differential equations. We will not discuss these applications here but you should should look out for uses of vector fields in the next few math courses.

For the second component with respect to <m>y</m>, we have <m>3x^{2}y + 6{y}^{3/2} + h(x)</m>. Notice here that we may take <m>g(y) = 6y^{3/2}</m> and <m>h(x)=0</m> (or any constant). Thus, we have <m>f(x,y) = 3x^{2}y + 6y^{3/2}</m>.

            The function found in <xref ref="part_act_Vector_VectorFields_Gradient_Potential" text="local">part</xref> is not unique because we could add any constant and still obtain the same gradient.

            Is the vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = 6xy\vi +(2x+9\sqrt{y})\vj</m> a gradient vector field?  Why or why not?

	      </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We will consider that <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle f_{x},\ f_{y} \rangle</m>. So <m>f_{x} = 6xy</m>, then <m>f_{xy} = 6x</m>. And if <m>f_{y} = 2x + 9y^{1/2}</m> then <m>f_{yx} = 2</m>. Therefore, this is not a gradient vector field, which would require that <m>f_{xy} = f_{yx}</m>.

            A <m>2</m>-dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of <m>\R^2</m> whose value is a <m>2</m>-dimensional vector. A <m>3</m>-dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of <m>\R^3</m> whose value is a <m>3</m>-dimensional vector.

            A vector field is typically described in terms of its multivariable component functions, <m>\vF(x,y)=\langle f(x,y),g(x,y)\rangle= f(x,y) \vi +g(x,y)\vj</m> or in 3D 
            <md>
              <mrow>\vF(x,y,z)\amp=\langle f(x,y,z),g(x,y,z),h(x,y,z)\rangle</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = f(x,y,z) \vi +g(x,y,z)\vj + h(x,y,z) \vk</mrow>

            Vector fields are generally plotted in ways that ensure the direction and relative magnitudes of the vectors sketched are correct instead of ensuring that each vector's magnitude is depicted correctly.

            The gradient of a function <m>f</m> of two or three variables is a vector field defined wherever <m>f</m> has partial derivatives.
