  <introduction>
    <p>
      Vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors
      (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>. The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. In <xref ref="vvf1_def" /> a curve is traced by the terminal point of <m>\vr(t)</m>, a function that has a real number as an input and produces a vector in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>. In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take a point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\R^2</m> (or a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> in <m>\R^3</m>) as an input and produce a vector (typically in <m>\R^2</m> or <m>\R^3</m>, respectively) as output.

        <introduction>
        <p>
        It's common when discussing weather to talk about the wind <term>speed</term>, but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo"/><per base="hour" /></quantity> without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing.
        If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. For instance, if you are taking off in a hot air balloon, the wind direction will determine which direction the chase team should start going to keep track of you.
        Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind <term>velocity</term> at each point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).

              Suppose that given a point <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane, you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector <m>\langle y,x\rangle</m>. For example, we'd then know that at the point <m>(1,-1)</m>, the wind velocity is <m>\langle -1,1\rangle</m>. We will give the wind velocity as a function <m>\vF</m>,where <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle</m>. In the table below, fill in the wind velocity vectors for the given points.

              A table of values of these vector-valued functions is useful to understand the input vs. output nature of a vector field as a function, but perhaps even better is a method of visualizing the vector outputs. A good picture is worth a thousand words (or numbers). Returning to our analogy of the output vector for our vector field being wind velocity, if <m>\vF(2,1) = \langle 1,2\rangle</m>, this means that at the location <m>(1,2)</m> the wind is moving in the direction given by <m>\langle 1,2\rangle</m>.

    <title>Examples of Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      As <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" /> showed, a <term>velocity vector field</term> is an example of a scenario
      where associating a vector to each point in a region is useful. We denote such a vector field by <m>\vF(x,y)</m> or <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m>, where the vector associated to the point <m>(x,y)</m> or <m>(x,y,z)</m> is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_FluidVelocity" /> shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.

          Green vectors representing the velocity vectors of a flowing fluid. The vectors along the vertical axis of syymmetry are directed from bottom to top and are longest in the middle. Vectors on either side of the vertical axis of symmetry form circular rotation patterns, clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. In the upper left corner, there is an inset figure that enlarges the center of rotation on the left side of the image.

    <p>
      Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects which is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth. The magnitude of the force vector is determined by the distance between the object and the earth (by an reciprocal squared relationship.) An illustration of this vector field can be seen in <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_gravity" />, where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at larger distances from the origin (Earth).

      As suggested in the introduction and <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" />, vector fields can be specified using the notation of functions and vectors.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="vf_def">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector field</term><idx><h>vectorfield</h><h>definition</h></idx> in <m>2</m>-space is function whose value at a point <m>(x,y)</m> is a <m>2</m>-dimensional vector <m>\vF(x,y)</m>.  Similarly, in <m>3</m>-space, a vector field is a function <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> whose value at the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> is a <m>3</m>-dimensional vector.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Since <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> is a vector, it has <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m> components. Each of these components is a scalar function of the point <m>(x,y,z)</m>, and so we will often write
      <me>
        \vF(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z)\vi + F_2(x,y,z)\vj + F_3(x,y,z)\vk
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if <m>\vF(x,y,z) = \langle x^2,xy\sin(z),y^3\rangle</m>, then the component functions of <m>\vF</m> would be <m>F_1(x,y,z) = x^2</m>, <m>F_2(x,y,z) = xy\sin(z)</m>, and <m>F_3(x,y,z) = y^3</m>. Any time we are considering a vector field <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m>, the definitions of functions <m>F_1</m>, <m>F_2</m>, and <m>F_3</m> should be infered in this manner. (For a vector field <m>\vF(x,y)</m> in <m>2</m>-space, we only have the functions <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m>, defined analogously.)

    <title>Plotting Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="PA_Vector_VectorFields" /> gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields <m>\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle</m> and <m>\vG(x,y) = \langle 0,-x\rangle</m>. It would be impossible to sketch <em>all</em> of
      the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computers can do a great job of making such sketches.  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors in computer plots are typically scaled, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in this text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj</m> in <xref ref="fig_Vector_VectorFields_scalefield" />.

      The left plot shows some of the vectors and accurately depicts all of their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand, especially along the lines <m>y=x</m> and <m>y=-x</m>. The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform rescaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vector's direction is completely accurate,
      but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the <em>relative</em> magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.

      Without using the terminology, we've actually already encountered one very important family of vector fields a number of times. Given a function <m>f</m> of two or three variables, the gradient of <m>f</m> is a vector field, since for any point where <m>f</m> has first-order partial derivatives, <m>\grad{f}</m> assigns a vector to that point (look at <xref ref="gradient_ss" /> for a review).

Sketch at least six vectors in the gradient vector field for each function. In making your sketches, you don't have to worry about getting vector magnitudes precise, but you should ensure that the relative magnitudes (and directions) are correct for each function independently.

            A <m>2</m>-dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of <m>\R^2</m> whose value is a <m>2</m>-dimensional vector. A <m>3</m>-dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of <m>\R^3</m> whose value is a <m>3</m>-dimensional vector.

  <title>Notes to the Instructor</title>
<p>
  This section uses tools from the chapter on multivariable functions and thier derivatives, with specific references to gradients. Additionally, vector calculations and geometry are used throughout to understand the output of the vector field.
