  <title>Why Multivariable?</title>
  <p>
    In previous calculus courses you have looked at how to measure limits, measuring the change and rate of change of a function, and the accumulation of the output of a function. All of these ideas and much of you algebra of functions has centered around functions that have one number as an input and one number as an output. Much of the meaning and tools for these ideas and associated measurements came from algebra and geometry that you learned in the years before you started calculus. We will need to do a bit of precalculus again before we look at our new calculus ideas. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The calculus you have done can't deal with graphs where <m>y\neq f(x)</m>. While you talked about motion in previous calculus courses, we will need to expand our tools, coordinates, and measurements to apply our work to motion in three dimensions, as would be needed to describe realistic physical problems. Many important quantities depend on more than one number as an input. For instance, when trying to find the optimal price for a product, you will need to consider fixed costs like a building lease, labor costs, and the varying costs of all the materials that are used in the product. Another example would be trying to measure the atmospheric temperature, which will vary in over a three dimensional space and will vary over time of day as well. If we wanted to use wind to help in modeling weather phenomena, we will need new tools since wind has both a direction and a strength associated with it, and thus cannot be measured by a single number. With our new an expanded view of the world around us, we will also need to describe some new basic examples of our mathematical objects that are algebraically nice to deal with and have a variety of features. While these ideas took years of math classes for you to understand and apply to the calculus of 1-variable in and 1 variable out, we will expand our tools in much less time because of all of the depth and variety we have already learned.
