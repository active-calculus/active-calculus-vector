            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </objectives>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In our previous work we have seen several examples of curves in space, such as lines in three dimensions and conic sections (in 2D). <xref ref="Lines-vector-form" text="custom" > For a line </xref> through a fixed point <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, we can express the line parametrically through the single vector equation
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \vr_0 + t \vv.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      From this perspective, <m>\vr(t)</m> is a function that depends on the parameter <m>t</m> and outputs a vector. When the output vectors are graphed with initial point at the origin, then the terminal points of this vector output will trace out the line in space, like <xref ref="Lineplot3d" />. We call <m>\vr(t)</m> a vector valued function of one variable (or simply a vector valued function, for now) because there is one scalar input (<m>t</m>) and the output of <m>\vr</m> is a vector that will vary based on the value of the scalar input. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Similar to lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects (there is only one way to move along this object, which we refer to as forward/backward), and thus we would like to similarly express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms of a single variable that would describe how we are moving along this path. For instance, the graph of an ellipse, like <xref ref="ellipse-ex1" />, cannot be expressed with <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, but an ellipse is still a one dimensional graph because at any point on the graph, there is only one dimension to move (forward/backward) along the graph. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vector valued functions (of one dimension) are the perfect vehicle for describing curves in general; we can use vectors based at the origin to identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us to draw an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to identify and describe curves in <m>n</m>-space for any <m>n</m>. This same approach to drawing curves will also allow us to represent traces and cross sections of surfaces in space, which we will discuss more in <xref ref="C_MVF" />.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          After graduating, you decide to start a self driving car company because it didn't look too hard based on a few articles you scrolled past online. You decide to call your company <em>Steer Clear</em> and start working on the self driving part of the car. Your first task is to understand how the location tracking equipment you bought online works. There are two parts to your location tracking system. A receiver box and a tracker that you put in the object you want to track. 
        </p>
      </introduction>

        <statement>
          <p>
            After putting the tracker in your pocket, you get in a car and drive around the receiver box. When you download the data about your drive, you notice that the software is outputting a vector from the receiver box to the tracker. The software also seems to love math, because these vectors are written in terms of trig functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are some of the output vectors from the software. Evaluate each of these vectors and draw each of these vectors with initial point at the origin on the same set of axes.

      In the preview activity, we saw how location data can be given by vectors relative to a common initial point. In this section, we will continue to look at the implications of using this as a description of movement along a curve.

      As in <xref ref="PA_9_6">Preview Activity</xref>, we can think of a point on the curve shown in <xref ref="vvf-example1">Figure</xref> as the terminal point of a vector starting at the origin. As the point we are looking at travels along the curve, the vector changes to terminate at the desired point. <xref ref="vvf-example1" /> shows a curve in space with a vector from the origin to a highlighted point on the curve. You can use the slider to change the location on the curve to see how changing the scalar input (parameter) will give different outputs with terminal points on the curve.

      This correspondence will allow us to think of a curve as a collection of terminal points of vectors emanating from the origin. We can describe an object traveling along this curve by defining a function <m>\vr</m> whose input is the variable <m>t</m> and whose output is the vector from the origin to the point on the curve at time <m>t</m>. In so doing, we have introduced a new type of function, one whose input is a scalar and whose output is a vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terminal points of the output vectors of <m>\vr</m> will trace out the curve in space. From this perspective, the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> coordinates of the point are functions of time, <m>t</m>,
      <me>
        x = x(t), \quad y = y(t), \quad \text{ and }  \quad z = z(t),
      </me>
      and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to represent the collection of points on the curve. The variable <m>t</m> is called a <term><em>parameter</em></term> and the equations <m>x = x(t)</m>, <m>y = y(t)</m>, and <m>z = z(t)</m> are called <term><em>parametric equations</em></term> (or a <term><em>parameterization of the curve</em></term>). The function <m>\vr</m> whose output is the vector from the origin to a point on the curve is defined by
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle.
      </me>
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      Note that the input of <m>\vr</m> is the real-valued parameter <m>t</m> and the corresponding output is vector <m>\langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle</m>. Such a function is called a <em>vector-valued function</em> because each real number input generates a vector output. More formally, we state the following definition.
    </p> -->
    <definition xml:id="vvf1_def">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector-valued function (of one variable)</term><idx><h>vector-valued function</h><h>definition</h></idx> is a function whose input is a real parameter <m>t</m> and whose output is a vector that depends on <m>t</m>. The <term>graph</term><idx><h>graph of a vector-valued function</h><h>definition</h></idx> of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <term>Parametric equations</term><idx><h>parametric equations for a curve</h></idx><idx><h>parameterization</h><h>curve</h></idx> for a curve are equations of the form
          <me>
            x = x(t), \quad y = y(t), \quad \text{ and }  \quad z = z(t)
          </me>
          that describe the <m>(x,y,z)</m> coordinates of a point on a curve in <m>\R^3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a vector-valued function of the form
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle
      </me>
      and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations for a curve. Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions as parameterizations in <m>\R^2</m>, <m>\R^3</m>, or any dimension. As a reminder, in <xref ref="S-Precalc-Lines">Section</xref>, we determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a point and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in <xref ref="vvf-example1">Figure</xref> has the parametric equations
      <me>
        x(t) = \cos(t), \quad y(t) = \sin(t), \quad \text{ and } \quad z(t)
        = \cos(t) \sin(t)
      </me>
      which is represented as the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \cos(t) \sin(t) \rangle
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we start working on parameterizations of curves, you may be asking yourself <q>Why can't we just have the output of our function be a point?</q> This is a good question because all things being equal, simpler tends to be better. But vectors have a LOT more tools and uses and we will use these vector tools throughout the rest of this course (and a few more) to make calculations easier and to make geometric sense of many measurements. For example, we used a (constant) vector to measure the direction a line moves and this vector is related to the location vectors along the path. Remember that we already have vector tools that allow us to separate measurements into different pieces (like magnitude or direction), or how much of a measurement is in a particular direction, or how much is orthogonal to another direction, or...

      The examples in <xref ref="A_9_6_1">Activity</xref> illustrate that a parameterization allows us to look not only at curve in space that is the graph of a vector valued function of one variable, but also at the direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as <m>t</m> changes. In the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can start at different points and move around the circle in either direction. In <xref ref="S-VVF-Calculus">Section</xref>, we will begin to investigate the calculus of vector-valued functions, which will enable us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of an object moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the points on the curve itself, but also to describe how motion can occur along the curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the ideas of a path or curve in space are closely related to a parameterization we will take a moment here to clarify these terms. A curve in space refers to the collection of points on the path. A curve does not have a specific direction to be traveled or even a particular way to move along points. A parameterization is an explicit description for how to travel along the points on the curve (in terms of the parameter <m>t</m>). A common analogy we will use is that a curve in space would be represented by a bike path or road and a parameterization would be a description for how you took a trip along this bike path or road (as a function of time).
    </p>  
    <p>
      In general, we will avoid having parameterizations that come to stop at any point on the curve or reverse their direction along the curve because many of the measurements we look at in this chapter will be undefined at these instances. It is common in practice to split your parameterization up into separate pieces that correspond to the intervals between where these stops or reversing happen. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      The graph of a vector valued function of one variable is the curve traced out by the endpoints of the output vectors, but this graph does not typically have parameter values labeled. This means that there is significant information lost when looking at the graph of a vector valued function because you don't have any indication of how the path is traveled/parameterized when looking at the graph.
    </p>
      <!-- should we show what the 3D plot of cos t,sin t looks like? -->
    <p>
      In the next subsection, we will cover some ideas that will be useful in parameterizing curves but first we will address a couple of ideas related to the new category of functions we will be studying. Remember that the big idea behind functions is that for each input there can only be one output assigned to that input. The domain of a function is the set of allowed inputs for the function. Sometimes a restricted set will be given that limits what inputs should be considered, but unless otherwise stated, the domain of a function will be the largest set of inputs for which the function is defined. Common ways for scalar functions to <em>NOT</em> be defined for a particular input include:
      <ul>
        <li>dividing by zero</li>
        <li>taking the square root of negative numbers</li>
        <li>restricted domains from other functions like <m>\arcsin</m> or logarithms</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The domain of of a vector valued function of one variable will the subset of <m>\R</m> where all of the component functions are defined. In other words, the domain of the vector valued function of one variable is the intersection of the domains for the component functions because that is the set of inputs for which the vector output will be defined.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        For example, if <m>\vr(t) = \langle \frac{-1}{t-2}, \sqrt{25-t^2}, \ln(t+1) \rangle</m>, then the domains of the component functions will be <m>\{x \in \R | x\neq 2\}</m>, <m>[-5,5]</m>, and <m>(-1,\infty)</m>. For only the parameter values that <em>all</em> three component functions are defined will <m>\vr</m> have an output. Thus the domain of <m>\vr(t)</m> will be <m>(-1,2)\cap(2,5]</m>.

    <title>Parameterizing Curves</title>
    <p>
      In this subsection, we will look at how to parameterize several types of curves in space. A bigger idea that will be used throughout the rest of the text is the way that different relationships of between coordinates can be expressed or understood.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two dimensions is much more versatile way of describing curves than defining <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>. In fact, if <m>y = f(x)</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, then we can parameterize the graph of <m>f</m> by
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle,
      </me>
      and thus the graph of every single-variable function may be described parametrically. In addition, as we saw in <xref ref="PA_9_6">Preview Activity</xref> and <xref ref="A_9_6_1">Activity</xref>, we can use vector-valued functions to represent curves in the plane that cannot be described with <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> (or <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>).
    </p>  
    <p> 
      As a side note: vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions. To see how, if <m>y = f(x)</m>defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this function by <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle</m>. Since the inverse function just reverses the role of input and output, a parameterization for <m>f^{-1}</m> is <m>\langle f(t), t \rangle</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Parameterizing <m>y=f(x)</m></title>
      <p>
        In this example we will look at parameterizing the parabola given by <m>(x-2)^2=8(y+1)</m>. From <xref ref="para-param" />, you can see that the graph of <m>(x-2)^2=8(y+1)</m> will pass the vertical line test, which means we can write the <m>y</m>-coordinate as a function of the <m>x</m>-coordinate. Specifically, we get <m>y=f(x)=\frac{(x-2)^2}{8}-1</m>. Using the idea above, we set <m>x=t</m> to be our parameter, which means we can express both coordinates of points on our curve as a function of <m>t</m>. In particular, setting <m>x(t)=t</m> means that we can write <m>y</m> as a function of <m>t</m> because <m>x=t</m>. Thus <m>x(t)=t</m> and <m>y(x)=y(t)=\frac{(t-2)^2}{8}-1</m> will parameterize the parabola given by <m>(x-2)^2=8(y+1)</m> and will correspond to the vector valued function <m>\vr(t) = \langle t , f(t) \rangle=\langle t,\frac{(t-2)^2}{8}-1 \rangle</m>.

        Remember that there is NOT a unique way to parameterize a curve, so the choices above are not the only way to describe motion on the given parabola. You could move along the curve with double the speed (relative to the previous example), which would give <m>\vr(t) = \langle 2t,\frac{(2t-2)^2}{8}-1 \rangle</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other choices for the parameterization might include wanting to center your parameter on the vertex (<m>t=0</m> corresponds to <m>(2,-1)</m>), which could give a parameterization like <m>\vr(t) =\langle t-2 , \frac{t^2-2}{2} \rangle</m>. Remember that there is more than one way to walk the same path.

     The intersection of surfaces in space are often curves and a convenient way of describing different conditions. Thus, we may determine parameterizations for these curves defined by satisfying multiple equations. For example, if <m>z = \cos(x^2 + y^2)</m>, the intersection with the <m>y = 1</m> fundamental plane is given by setting <m>y = 1</m> in <m>z = \cos(x^2 + y^2)</m>. We can then let <m>x</m> be parameterized by the variable <m>t</m>; then, the intersection of <m>z = \cos(x^2 + y^2)</m> and the <m>y = 1</m> fundamental plane is the curve given by the parameterization <m>\langle t, 1, \cos(t^2 + 1)\rangle</m>.

      As you saw in <xref ref="A_9_6_4" />, it will be convenient to parameterize conic sections and other curves defined by common relationships between coordinates. In our next activity, we will generalize our work for parameterizing circles earlier to give a general parameterized of a translated ellipse. These ideas are extended in Exercises where hyperbolas and parabolas are parameterized.

          Earlier we saw that to parametrize the implicit equation of a circle with center <m>(h,k)</m> and radius <m>r \gt 0</m> given by
          <me> (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 </me>
          we can use the relationship between <m>\sin</m> and <m>\cos</m>. We found a parametric equation for the circle can be expressed by 
          <me>x(t) =r \cos(\theta) + h \qquad y(t) = r \sin(\theta) + k.</me>
          The conic section most closely related to the circle is the ellipse. The general equation of an ellipse (centered at the origin) is given by

          A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real parameter <m>t</m> and whose output is a vector that depends on <m>t</m>. The graph of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.

          Every vector-valued function provides a parameterization of a curve. In <m>\R^2</m>, a parameterization of a curve is a pair of equations <m>x = x(t)</m> and <m>y = y(t)</m> that describes the coordinates of a point <m>(x,y)</m> on the curve in terms of a parameter <m>t</m>. In <m>\R^3</m>, a parameterization of a curve is a set of three equations <m>x = x(t)</m>, <m>y=y(t)</m>, and <m>z = z(t)</m> that describes the coordinates of a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve in terms of a parameter <m>t</m>.
