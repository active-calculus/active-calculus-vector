  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have seen several different examples of curves in space such as lines in 3-space. Recall that for a line through a fixed point <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, we may express the line parametrically through the single vector equation
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      From this perspective, the vector <m>\vr(t)</m> is a function that depends on the parameter <m>t</m>, and when the output vectors are graphed with initial point at the origin, then the terminal points of this vector output will trace out the line in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects (there is only one way to move along this object, which we refer to as forward/backward), and thus we aspire to similarly express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms of a single variable. Vectors are a perfect
      vehicle for doing so <mdash/> we can use vectors based at the origin to
      identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these
      vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us to draw
      an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to
      identify and describe curves in <m>n</m>-space for any <m>n</m>. It will also allow us to represent traces and cross sections of surfaces in space.

  <subsection>
    <title>Vector-Valued Functions</title>
    <p>
      Consider the curve shown in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref>. As in
      <xref ref="PA_9_6">Preview Activity</xref>, we can think of a point on this curve
      as resulting from a vector from the origin to the point. As the point
      travels along the curve, the vector changes in order to terminate at
      the desired point.
      A few still pictures of this motion are shown in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_9_6_VVF_graph">
      <caption>The graph of a curve in space.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="33% 33% 33%" margins="0%">
      <image source="images/fig_9_6_curve_animate_01"/>
      <image source="images/fig_9_6_curve_animate_25"/>
      <image source="images/fig_9_6_curve_animate_40"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of
      vectors emanating from the origin. We therefore view a point traveling
      along this curve as a function of time <m>t</m>, and define a function
      <m>\vr</m> whose input is the variable <m>t</m> and whose output is the vector
      from the origin to the point on the curve at time <m>t</m>. In so doing,
      we have introduced a new type of function, one whose input is a scalar
      and whose output is a vector.
    </p>

    <p>
      The terminal points of the vector outputs of <m>\vr</m> then trace out the
      curve in space. From this perspective, the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>
      coordinates of the point are functions of time, <m>t</m>, say
      <me>
        x = x(t), \ \ \ y = y(t), \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ z = z(t),
      </me>
      and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to
      represent the curve. The variable <m>t</m> is called a <em>parameter</em> and
      the equations <m>x = x(t)</m>, <m>y = y(t)</m>, and <m>z = z(t)</m> are called
      <em>parametric equations</em> (or a <em>parameterization of the
      curve</em>). The function <m>\vr</m> whose output is the vector from the
      origin to a point on the curve is defined by
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the input of <m>\vr</m> is the real-valued parameter <m>t</m> and the
      corresponding output is vector <m>\langle x(t), y(t), z(t)
      \rangle</m>. Such a function is called a <em>vector-valued function</em>
      because each real number input generates a vector output. More
      formally, we state the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="vvf1_def">

          A <term>vector-valued

          function whose input is a real parameter <m>t</m> and whose output is
          a vector that depends on <m>t</m>. The <term>graph</term><idx><h>graph of a
          vector-valued function</h><h>definition</h></idx> of a vector-valued function
          is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with
          their initial points at the origin.

          <term>Parametric equations</term><idx><h>parametric equations for a
          curve</h></idx><idx><h>parameterization</h><h>curve</h></idx> for a curve are equations of the form
          <me>
            x = x(t), \ \ \ y = y(t), \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ z = z(t)
          </me>
          that describe the <m>(x,y,z)</m> coordinates of a point on a curve in <m>\R^3</m>.
        </p>

      </statement>
    </definition>

    
    <p>
      Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a
      vector-valued function of the form
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle,
      </me>
      and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations
      for a curve. Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions and
      parameterizations in <m>\R^2</m>, <m>\R^4</m>, or indeed a real space of any
      dimension. As a reminder, in <xref ref="S-9-5-Lines-Planes">Section</xref>, we
      determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a point
      and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref> has the parametric equations
      <me>
        x(t) = \cos(t), \ \ \ y(t) = \sin(t), \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ z(t)
        = \cos(t) \sin(t).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Represented as a vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>,
      the curve in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref> is the graph of
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \cos(t) \sin(t) \rangle.

      The examples in <xref ref="A_9_6_1">Activity</xref> illustrate that a
      parameterization allows us to look not only at the graph, but at the
      direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as <m>t</m> changes. In
      the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can
      start at different points and move around the circle in either
      direction. The calculus of vector-valued functions <mdash/> which we will
      begin to investigate in
      <xref ref="S-9-7-Vector-Valued-Functions-Derivatives">Section</xref> <mdash/> will enable
      us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of a
      particle moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves
      parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the curve itself,
      but also to describe how motion occurs along the curve.

    <p>
      Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two
      dimensions is much more versatile than just defining <m>y</m> as a function
      of <m>x</m>. In fact, if <m>y = f(x)</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, then we can
      parameterize the graph of <m>f</m> by
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle,
      </me>
      and thus every single-variable function may be described
      parametrically. In addition, as we saw in <xref ref="PA_9_6">Preview Activity</xref> and <xref ref="A_9_6_1">Activity</xref>, we can use vector-valued
      functions to represent curves in the plane that do not define <m>y</m> as a
      function of <m>x</m> (or <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>). (As a side note: vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions. To see how, if <m>y = f(x)</m>defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this function by <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle</m>. Since the inverse function just reverses the role of input and output, a parameterization for <m>f^{-1}</m> is <m>\langle f(t), t \rangle</m>.)

      Recall from our earlier work that the traces and level curves of a
      function are themselves curves in space. Thus, we may determine
      parameterizations for them. For example, if <m>z = f(x,y) = \cos(x^2 +
      y^2)</m>, the <m>y = 1</m> trace of the function is given by setting <m>y = 1</m>
      and letting <m>x</m> be parameterized by the variable <m>t</m>; then, the trace
      is the curve whose parameterization is <m>\langle t, 1, \cos(t^2 + 1)
      \rangle.</m>

          A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real
            parameter <m>t</m> and whose output is a vector that depends on <m>t</m>. The
            graph of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points
            of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Every vector-valued function provides a parameterization of a
            curve. In <m>\R^2</m>, a parameterization of a curve is a pair of
            equations <m>x = x(t)</m> and <m>y = y(t)</m> that describes the coordinates
            of a point <m>(x,y)</m> on the curve in terms of a parameter <m>t</m>. In
            <m>\R^3</m>, a parameterization of a curve is a set of three equations <m>x
            = x(t)</m>, <m>y=y(t)</m>, and <m>z = z(t)</m> that describes the coordinates of
            a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve in terms of a parameter <m>t</m>.

                    Solve the first equation for <m>z</m> to get <m>z = x + 2y - 4</m>. Substiture into the second equation to get <m>3x + y - 2(x + 2y -4) = 1</m>. Solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3}</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Let <m>x = t</m>. Then <m>y = \frac{1}{3}t + \frac{7}{3}</m>. Substitute these equations into <m>z = x + 2y -4</m> to get <m>z = \frac{5}{3}t + \frac{14}{3}</m>.

                    Therefore, <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, \frac{1}{3}t + \frac{7}{3}, \frac{5}{3}t + \frac{14}{3} \rangle</m>.

                    If you let <m>y = t</m>, you would get <m>\vr(t) = \langle -7 + 3t, t, -11 + 5t \rangle</m>.
