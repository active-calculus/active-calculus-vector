    <introduction>
    <p>
      Quantities like length, speed, area, and mass are all measured using a single number (a <em>scalar</em>). Other quantities, like velocity, force, and displacement, have two attributes: magnitude and direction. These quantities are represented by <em>vectors</em> and are the study of this section. For example, we will use vectors to calculate work done by a constant force, calculate torque, determine direction vectors for lines and normal vectors for planes, define curvature, and determine the direction of greatest increase on a surface. For most of these applications, we will be interested in using vectors to measure the direction of some aspect of the application while needing to also pay attention to the magnitude of this measurement. Vectors will be an essential tool for us in describing the behavior of functions of several variables. 
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      If we are at a point <m>x</m> in the domain of a function of one variable, there are only two directions in which we can move: in the positive or negative <m>x</m>-direction. If, however, we are at a point <m>(x,y)</m> in the domain of a function of two variables, there are many directions in which we can move. Thus, it is important for us to have a means to indicate direction, and we will do so using vectors. This notion of direction in space will be critical for us to find direction vectors for lines, tangent lines to curves, normal vectors to planes, and to determine direction of motion.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to specify how to generate text or graphics. The following is a simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(1,1)</m>, and <m>(1,-1)</m>:
            <cd> 
              (0,0) moveto 
              (1,1) lineto stroke
              (1,-1) lineto stroke
              (0,0) lineto stroke
            </cd>
          The process described by these commands is 1) tell Postscript to start at the point <m>(0,0)</m>, 2) draw a line from the point <m>(0,0)</m> to the point <m>(1,1)</m> (this is what the line to and stroke commands do), then 3) draw lines from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(1,-1)</m> and 4) <m>(1,-1)</m> back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair <m>\langle x, y \rangle</m> (this pair <m>\langle x, y \rangle</m> is a <term>vector</term>), where <m>x</m> is the horizontal displacement and <m>y</m> the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point <m>(1,1)</m> is represented by <m>\langle 1,1 \rangle</m> but the vector from the point <m>(1,1)</m> to the origin is represented by <m>\langle -1,-1 \rangle</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Representations of Vectors</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="PA-9-2">Preview Activity</xref> shows how we can record the length and direction of a change in position using a pair of numbers <m>\langle x,y\rangle</m>. In particular, these numbers measure the change in each coordinate direction separately. There are many quantities other than displacement, such as force and velocity, that possess the attributes of magnitude and direction, and we will call such quantity a <em>vector</em>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector</term><idx><h>vector</h><h>definition</h></idx> is a quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment, with the magnitude as the length of the segment and an arrowhead indicating direction, as shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-single">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    
      <figure xml:id="F-9-2-vectors-single">
      <caption>Left: A vector. Right: Representations of the same vector.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
        <image source="images/fig_9_2_single"/>
        <image source="images/fig_9_2_multiple"/>
        </sidebyside>
      </figure>
    

    <p>
      According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of magnitude (length) and direction; the vector's position, however, is not mentioned. Consequently, any two vectors having the same magnitude and direction are equal, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-single">Figure</xref>. In other words, two vectors are <term>equal</term> provided they have the same magnitude and direction. This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many different ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vectors do not have a particular starting or ending point, but it will be useful to use directed line segments like <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> as a specific representative of a vector. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector <m>\langle 3, 4\rangle</m>, which represents a horizontal change of (positive) three units and a vertical change of (positive) four units. We may place the <em>tail</em> of the vector (the point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the <em>tip</em> (the terminal point of the vector) at <m>(3,4)</m>, as illustrated at left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-standard">Figure</xref>. A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in <term><em>standard position</em></term>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        The point at the tail of a vector is often called the initial point or starting point. The point at the end of the vector is often called the terminal point or final point. The entries of the vector measure the change in each coordinate separately. Remember that change is measured as <q>final minus initial</q>.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector <m>\langle 3,4\rangle</m> at another point, such as <m>Q=(1,1)</m>. After a displacement of three units to the right and four units up, the tip of the vector is at the point <m>R=(4,5)</m> (see the vector on right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-standard" />).
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, the vector was represented by the directed line segment from <m>Q</m> to <m>R</m>, which we denote as <m>\overrightarrow{QR}</m>. We may also turn the situation around: given the two points <m>Q</m> and <m>R</m>, we obtain the vector <m>\langle 3,4\rangle</m> because we move horizontally three units and vertically four units to get from <m>Q</m> to <m>R</m>. In other
      words, <m>\overrightarrow{QR} = \langle 3,4\rangle</m>. In general, the vector <m>\overrightarrow{QR}</m> from the point <m>Q = (q_1, q_2)</m> to <m>R = (r_1, r_2)</m> is found by taking the difference of coordinates, so that
      <me>
        \overrightarrow{QR} = \langle r_1-q_1, r_2-q_2 \rangle.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We will use arrows over the name/letters to represent vectors, such as <m>\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle</m>, to distinguish them from scalars. The entries of a vector are called its <em>components</em>; in the vector <m>\langle 3, 4 \rangle</m>, the <m>x</m> component is 3 and the <m>y</m> component is 4. We use pointed brackets <m>\langle , \rangle</m> and the term <em>components</em> to distinguish a vector from a point <m>( , )</m> and its <em>coordinates</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      There is, however, a close connection between vectors and points. Given a point <m>P</m>, we will frequently consider the vector <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> from the origin <m>O</m> to <m>P</m>. For instance, if <m>P=(3,4)</m>, then <m>\overrightarrow{OP}=\langle 3,4\rangle</m> as in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors4">Figure</xref>. In this way, we think of a point <m>P</m> as defining a vector <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> whose components agree with the coordinates of <m>P</m>. The vector <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> is called the <term><em>position vector</em></term><idx><h>position vector</h></idx> of <m>P</m>.

    <p>
      While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since pictures will be easier to draw and demonstrate the necessary characteristics, many situations will require the use of vectors in three or more dimensions. For instance, a vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>n</m>-dimensional space, <m>\R^n</m>, has <m>n</m> components and may be represented as
      <me>
        \vv = \langle v_1, v_2, v_3,  \ldots, v_n \rangle.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next activity will help us to become accustomed to vectors and their relationship to points in three dimensions.

          After being bored in your previous calculus class (and definitely not in multivariable calculus) you count the floor tiles to see how large the room is. You now know that the room is 32 feet wide and 42 feet in length. Additionally, your tall friend Chuck can barely jump and touch the ceiling which means the ceiling is 10 feet high. Your calculus professor notices you doing these measurements and decides to create a classroom coordinate system. Your professor walks to the center of the room and notices that their head is five feet above the ground and sets their head as the origin of the classroom coordinate system. Your friend Alice is sitting at <m>A = (9, -6, -2.5)</m>, a projector is located at position <m>B = (0,1,9)</m>, and your rival Carlos is standing at point <m>C = (-2, 20, -5)</m>, all distances are measured in feet.

    <title>Equality of Vectors</title>
    <p>
      Because initial and final locations are not mentioned in the definition of a vector, any two vectors that have the same magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have an algebraic way to determine when this occurs. That is, if we know the components of two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, we will want to be able to determine algebraically when <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are equal. There is an straightforward set of conditions that we use in terms of components.

        Two vectors <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> and <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle</m> in <m>\R^2</m> are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal: <m>u_1 = v_1</m> and <m>u_2 = v_2</m>.

    <title>Operations on Vectors</title>
    <p>
      Vectors are not numbers (scalars), but we can now represent them with components that are real numbers. As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible to add two vectors together, multiply two vectors, or combine vectors in any other ways. In this section, we will study two operations on vectors: vector addition and scalar multiplication. To begin, we investigate a natural way to think about combining vectors in the context of measuring the change of location.

          After hiking to the location suggested by the ranger, you still don't see your friend and call the ranger station again.

A drone spotted your friend along the same direction from your car to your current location but your friend is three times as far away you are from your car.

      In <xref ref="Act-navigation" /> we saw how adding two vectors componentwise gave a vector that represented the total change of traveling along one vector then doing the change described by the other vector. Additionally, we saw that if we wanted to go three times as far in a direction given by a vector, then we could describe the total change by multiplying each component by three. Finally, we saw that we could find the difference between two vectors by subtracting componentwise. This difference vector completed a triangle given by starting the two vectors at the same initial point. The ideas of adding vectors or multiplying a scalar by a vector generalizes beyond the context of <xref ref="Act-navigation" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, we can add vectors <m>\vv=\langle v_1,\ldots,v_n \rangle</m> and <m>\vw=\langle w_1,\ldots,w_n \rangle</m> componentwise to get <m>\vv+\vw=\langle v_1+w_1,\ldots,v_n+w_n\rangle</m>, where <m>\vv+\vw</m> gives the total change described by <m>\vv</m> then <m>\vw</m>. We define the scalar multiplication of vectors componentwise as well; If <m>k</m> is a real number, then <m>k\vv = \langle k v_1,\ldots, k v_n \rangle </m>. Geometrically, the scalar multiplication of <m>k</m> by <m>\vv</m> will scale (stretch/shrink) <m>\vv</m> by a factor of <m>k</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we can add together scalar multiples of vectors. This allows us to define <em>vector subtraction</em><idx><h>vector</h><h>subtraction</h></idx>, <m>\vv - \vu</m>, as the sum of <m>\vv</m> and <m>-1</m> times <m>\vu</m>, so that
      <me>
        \vv - \vu = \vv + (-1)\vu.
      </me>
      You can alternatively think of of <m>\vv-\vu</m> as the vector you need to add to <m>\vu</m> to get a result of <m>\vv</m> (as you did in <xref ref="Act-nav-sub" />.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often represent vectors in terms of the special vectors <m>\vi = \langle 1, 0 \rangle</m> and <m>\vj = \langle 0,1 \rangle</m>. For instance,
      we can write the vector <m>\langle a, b \rangle</m> in <m>\R^2</m> as
      <me>
        \langle a, b \rangle = a\langle 1, 0 \rangle + b\langle 0, 1 \rangle = a \vi + b \vj,
      </me>
      which means that
      <me>
        \langle 2, -3 \rangle = 2\vi - 3\vj.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In <m>\R^3</m>, we let <m>\vi = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle</m>, <m>\vj = \langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m>, and <m>\vk = \langle 0,0,1 \rangle</m>, and we can write the vector <m>\langle a, b, c \rangle</m> in <m>\R^3</m> as
      <me>
        \langle a, b,c \rangle = a\langle 1, 0,0 \rangle + b\langle 0, 1,0 \rangle + c\langle 0,0,1 \rangle = a \vi + b \vj + c \vk.
      </me>
      Here is the cursed i version I made <m>\cursedihat</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      The vectors <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m> are called the <em>standard unit vectors</em> (as we will learn momentarily, unit vectors have length 1), and are commonly used in the physical sciences.

    <title>Properties of Vector Operations</title>
    <p>
      We know that the sum (of scalars) <m>1+2</m> is equal to the sum <m>2+1</m>. This is called the <em>commutative</em> property of scalar addition. Any time we define operations on objects (like addition of vectors) we usually want to know what kinds of properties the operations have. For example, is addition of vectors a commutative operation? To answer this question we take two <em>arbitrary</em> vectors <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vu</m> and add them together and see what happens. Let <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle</m> and <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m>. Now we use the fact that <m>v_1</m>, <m>v_2</m>, <m>u_1</m>, and <m>u_2</m> are scalars, and that the addition of scalars is commutative to see that
      <md>
        <mrow>\vv + \vu  =\mathstrut \amp  \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle + \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</mrow>
        <mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  \langle v_1+u_1, v_2 + u_2 \rangle </mrow>
        <mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  \langle u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2 \rangle </mrow>
        <mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle + \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle </mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vu + \vv.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

      We verified the first property for vectors in <m>\R^2</m>; it is straightforward to verify that the rest of the eight properties just noted hold for all vectors in <m>\R^n</m> since all of the operations are done componentwise on the vectors.

    <title>Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations</title>
    <p>
      Next, we explore the geometric representations of vector addition and scalar multiplication which will allow us to visualize these operations. Let <m>\vu = \langle 4, 6 \rangle</m> and <m>\vv = \langle 3, -2 \rangle</m>. Then <m>\vw = \vu + \vv = \langle 7, 4 \rangle</m>, as shown on the left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      If we think of these vectors as displacements (measuring change in position) in the plane, we can see a geometric way to envision vector addition. For instance, the vector <m>\vu + \vv</m> will represent the displacement obtained by following the displacement <m>\vu</m> with the displacement <m>\vv</m>. We may picture this by placing the tail of <m>\vv</m> at the tip of <m>\vu</m>, as seen in the center of <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum">Figure</xref>. In other words, the change described by <m>\vu+\vv</m> is given by going along <m>\vu</m> then immediately along <m>\vv</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if we place the tail of <m>\vu</m> at the tip of <m>\vv</m>. We therefore see that <m>\vu+\vv</m> appears as the diagonal of the parallelogram<idx><h>vector</h><h>sum, parallelogram</h></idx> determined by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation. At left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-addition" /> we see vectors <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>, and <m>\vw =\vu + \vv</m>. If we rewrite <m>\vv = \vw - \vu</m>, we have the arrangement shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-addition">Figure</xref>. In other words, to form the difference <m>\vw-\vu</m>, we draw a vector from the tip of <m>\vu</m> to the tip of <m>\vw</m>. This should make sense with our other interpretation of vector subtraction as well; the vector <m>\vw-\vu</m> is what you need to add to <m>\vu</m> to get <m>\vw</m>, which is stated algebraically as <m> \vu + \underline{\vw-\vu} = \vw</m>.

    <p>
      In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a vector. For instance, if <m>\vv=\langle 2,3\rangle</m>, then <m>2\vv = \langle 4,6\rangle</m>. As shown in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum7">Figure</xref>, multiplying <m>\vv</m> by 2 leaves the direction unchanged, but stretches <m>\vv</m> by 2. Remember that <m>2\vv = \vv +\vv</m>, which describes the total change of doing <m>\vv</m> then <m>\vv</m> again and thus gives a result that will be in same direction as <m>\vv</m>. Also, <m>-2\vv = \langle -4, -6\rangle</m>, which shows that multiplying by a negative scalar gives a vector pointing in the opposite direction of <m>\vv</m>.

      <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum7" /> motivates the following definition of parallel vectors; Vectors <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vw</m> (in <m>\R^n</m> are parallel if there exists a non-zero scalar <m>k\in\R</m> such that <m>\vv = k \vw</m>. In other words, parallel vectors are (non-zero) scalar multiples of each other. There are a couple of things to note that are important about parallel vectors. First, the zero vector, <m>\vzero = \langle 0, \ldots, 0\rangle \in \R^n</m> is not parallel to any other vector. Geometrically, this should make sense because the zero vector is the only vector that has no change and that will not correspond to any direction. Second, parallel vectors do not have to be in the same direction; in fact, parallel vectors can be in exactly opposite directions, as shown by <m>\vv</m> and <m>-2\vv</m> in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum7" />. Parallel vectors are extremely useful when trying to classify the orientation of lines, planes, and changes on surfaces.

      Before we move on to the magnitude of a vector, we will take a moment to point out a concept that permeates most the mathematics you will see for awhile. Our definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication give us a way to take a few vectors and generate entire spaces with both familiar algebraic and geometric properties. We say that <m>a\vv + b\vw</m> is a <term>linear combination</term> of the vectors <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vw</m> (where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are scalars). Earlier in this section we mentioned how every vector in <m>\R^3</m> can be written as a linear combination of <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>. Important questions in the next few math courses include things like <q>Can you write any vector in <m>\R^n</m> as a linear combination of <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>, and <m>\vw</m></q>? For now, we will point out that much of what has been done in this section is setting up the algebraic and geometric properties of linear combinations as a function of the vectors used.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>The Magnitude of a Vector</title>
    <p>
      By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or length). We will now investigate how to calculate the magnitude of a vector. Since a vector <m>\vv</m> can be represented by a directed line segment, we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of the segment. This length is the <em>magnitude</em> of the vector <m>\vv</m> and is denoted <m>\Vert\vv\Vert</m>.
    </p>


    <example>
      <p>
        The magnitude of a vector is measured as a the length of the directed line segments that represent the vector. For example, the directed line segment <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-magnitude-a" /> will represent a vector with components of <m>2</m> and <m>4</m>, which represent the horizontal and vertical changes from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>. Notice that when we apply the distance formula to find the length of the segment from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, we compute <m>(x_B-x_A)</m> and <m>(y_B-y_A)</m> which are the components of the vector we are finding the magnitude of. 
        <md>
          <mrow>\Vert\overrightarrow{AB}\Vert \amp= \sqrt{(x_B-x_A)^2+(y_B-y_A)^2} \amp= \sqrt{(2)^2+(4)^2}</mrow>  
          <mrow>  \amp= \sqrt{(v_1)^2+(v_2)^2} \amp= \sqrt{20}</mrow>

        Because the distance formula in <m>\R^n</m> uses the sum of the squares of the change in each coordinate, we can see that given a vector <m>\vv=\langle v_1, \v_2, \ldots, \v_n \rangle \in \R^n</m> will have magnitude <m>\Vert \vv \Vert = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+\ldots+v_n^2}</m>. Vectors of length one will be useful for describing directions without a focus on the magnitude. A <term><em>unit vector</em></term> is a vector whose magnitude is 1. Scalar multiplication gives us a very useful tool for describing a unit vector in a particular direction because we will need to stretch/shrink a given vector to length 1. Our vector given by <m>\overrightarrow{AB}=\langle 2,4\rangle</m> will have magnitude <m>\sqrt{20}</m>, so the vector <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{20}}\langle2,4\rangle</m> will have length 1 and will be in the same direction as <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>.
        <me>\left\Vert \left\langle \frac{2}{\sqrt{20}},\frac{4}{\sqrt{20}}\right\rangle \right\Vert=\sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{20}}\right)^2+\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{20}}\right)^2}=\sqrt{\frac{4}{20}+\frac{16}{20}}=1</me>

        <p>
          A vector is an object that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities are position, velocity, acceleration, and force.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Two vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude. Notice that position is not considered, so a vector is independent of its location.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \rangle</m> and <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \rangle</m> are two vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, then their vector sum is the vector
          <me>
            \vu + \vv = \langle u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2, \ldots, u_n+v_n \rangle
          </me>
          If <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \rangle</m> is a vector in <m>\R^n</m> and <m>c</m> is a scalar, then the scalar multiple <m>c\vu</m> is the vector          
          <me>
            c\vu = \langle cu_1, cu_2, \ldots, cu_n \rangle.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The magnitude of the vector <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \rangle</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the scalar
          <me>
            \Vert\vv\Vert = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+ \cdots + v_n^2}.
          </me>
          A vector <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector provided that <m>\Vert\vu\Vert = 1</m>. If <m>\vv</m> is a nonzero vector, then the vector <m>\frac{\vv}{\Vert\vv\Vert}</m> is a unit vector with the same direction as <m>\vv</m>.
