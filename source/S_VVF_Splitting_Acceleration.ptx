    <introduction>
    <p>
      Velocity and acceleration are vital ideas in motion and mechanics. Velocity is the derivative of position/location (the central measurement of in kinematics, the study of motion). To understand velocity as a vector valued function of time, we wanated to understand how the magnitude and direction of position change. We separated velocity into its critical parts, namely speed (magnitude of velocity) and unit tangent vector (direction of travel). Speed measures how fast (as a scalar) position is changing as a function of time and <m>\vT</m> measurese in what direction position is changing (measured with a unit vector).
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton's Second Law of Motion relates the forces acting on an object to its acceleration through the formula <m> \vec{F}_{net}= m \vec{A}</m>, which is summarized as the sum of the forces acting on an object is the same as the mass times the acceleration of the object. We would like to understand acceleration as a change in the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. In this section we will use our knowledge of calculus and vector measurements to split the acceleration vector up into parts dealing with changes in he magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. Further, we wil make sense of these measurements in terms of thier physical meaning.

      <statement> 
      <p>
        Preview activity will have drawing/algebraic version of T, N, v, and a. Look at a few points and calculate how much of a is in the direction of T? How much of a is in the direction N? Hint is to use projection or should we just tell them to use the projection. 
        Might want to use this as the opportunity to reinforce that v and a are the easiest calculations.

    <title>Splitting Acceleration</title>
  <p>
    Remember that <m>\vv</m> is parallel to <m>\vT</m> (when not the zero vector or DNE) and that <m>\vT \cdot \vN =0 </m>. 
    Define <m>a_\vT = \va \cdot \vT </m> as the tangential component of acceleration and <m>a_\vN = \va \cdot \vN </m> as the normal component of acceleration. Because <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal to each other and both unit vectors, <m>a_\vT</m> and  <m>a_\vN</m> will give the amount of acceleration in the direction of travel and the direction of turning, respectively. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Can acceleration have any additional parts? Can a have any component in another direction (like <m>\vB</m>)? 

    No!
  </p>
  <p>
    The scalar <m>a_\vN</m> measures the acceleration due to change in the direction of <m>\vv</m> and the scalar <m>a_\vT</m> measures the acceleration due to the change in magnitude of <m>\vv</m>. This interpretation follows from a neat product rule argument:
    <md>
       <mrow> \vv(t) =\amp speed(t) \vT(t) </mrow>
       <mrow> \frac{d\vv}{dt} =\amp \frac{d}{dt}(speed) \vT + (speed) \frac{d\vT}{dt} </mrow>
       <mrow> \frac{d\vv}{dt} =\amp \frac{d}{dt}(speed) \vT + (speed) \Vert\frac{d\vT}{dt}\Vert \vN </mrow>
    </md>
    The last line follows from the definition of the unit normal vector (<m>\vN=\frac{\vT'}{\Vert\vT'\Vert}</m>)
  </p>
  <p>
    This gives a nice way to interpret <m>a_\vT</m>. Specifically, <m>a_\vT</m> is the rate of change of speed!
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>a_\vN</m> is much harder to interpret right now because we have <m>a_\vN = (speed) \Vert\frac{d\vT}{dt}\Vert</m> and <m> frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> (and <m> \Vert\frac{d\vT}{dt}\Vert</m>) are just as hard to calculate as <m>\vN</m> directly. In the next section, we will address the meaning of <m>a_\vN</m> a bit more, but for now you should think of <m>a_\vN</m> as the acceleration due to a change in the direciton. In other words, <m>a_\vN</m> is the amount of acceleration due to turning.

        Activity about how a_T can be positive, negative, zero and thier respective meanings.
        Activity about how a_N can only be positive or zero. What is the meaning of this?

        activity about the mechanisms of driving, biking, boating and how these connect ot a_n, a_t, T, and N.

    </statement>
    <example>
      <p>
        Calculate trying to find a_N, a_T for t,t^2,t^3 for all t. a_N is most easily calculated by <m>\Vert \va - a_\vT \vT \Vert</m>.
        Show a plot of the curve and values/vectors at t=2 to emphasize these calculations and hwo they can be one at a single value. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      emphasize the efficient calculation formulas 
      <md>
        <mrow>\vT =\amp \frac{\vv}{\Vert\vv\Vert} </mrow>
        <mrow> a_\vT =\amp \frac{\va\cdot\vv}{\Vert\vv\Vert} \Rightarrow a_\vT \vT = \frac{\va\cdot \vv}{\vv \cdot \vv} \vv</mrow>
      </md>
      That last part emphasizes that <m>a_\vT \vT</m> is the projection of acceleration onto velocity. 
      <md>
        <mrow> a_\vN =\amp \Vert \va - a_\vT \vT \Vert = \sqrt{\Vert \va \Vert - (a_\vT)^2}= \sqrt{(\va \cdot \va)- \frac{(\va\cdot\vv)^2}{\Vert\vv\Vert}} </mrow>

          The integration process shows that the length <m>L</m> of a smooth curve defined by <m>\vr(t)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is
          <me>
            L = \int_a^b |\vr'(t)| \, dt.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We define the curvature <m>\kappa</m> of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or
          <me>
            \kappa = \left\lvert \frac{d\vT}{ds} \right\rvert.
          </me>
