    <introduction>
    <p>
      A vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> determines a curve in space as the
      collection of terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If the curve is
      smooth, it is natural to ask whether <m>\vr(t)</m> has a derivative. In
      the same way, our experiences with integrals in single-variable
      calculus prompt us to wonder what the integral of a vector-valued
      function might be and what it might tell us. We
      explore both of these questions in detail in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, let's recall some important ideas from calculus I. Given a
      function <m>s</m> that measures the position of an object moving along
      an axis, its derivative, <m>s'</m>, is defined by
      <me>
        s'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(t+h) - s(t)}{h},
      </me>
      and measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>s</m> with respect to
      time. In particular, for a fixed value <m>t = a</m>, <m>s'(a)</m> measures the
      velocity of the moving object, as well as the slope of the tangent
      line to the curve <m>y = s(t)</m> at the point <m>(a,s(a))</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we work with vector-valued functions, we will strive to update
      these ideas and perspectives into the context of curves in space and
      outputs that are vectors.

    <title>The Derivative</title>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, <m>f'</m>, of a
      given function <m>f</m> by
      <me>
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},
      </me>
      provided the limit exists. At a given value of <m>a</m>, <m>f'(a)</m> measures
      the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m>, and also tells us the slope
      of the tangent line to the curve <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a, f(a))</m>.
      The definition of the derivative extends naturally to vector-valued
      functions and curves in space.

            The vector <m>\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)</m> represents a change in position of the object on the time interval <m>[t, t+h]</m>.
            When we multiply by <m>\frac{1}{h}</m>,
            we can consider this vector

            The average velocity vector
            <m>\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</m> is a direction vector for the secant line to the curve that passes through the terminal points of <m>\vr(t)</m> and <m>\vr(t+h)</m>.
            As we let <m>h \to 0</m>,
            these direction vectors approach a direction vector

    <p>
      As <xref ref="A_9_7_1">Activity</xref> indicates, if <m>\vr(t)</m> determines the
      position of an object at time <m>t</m>, then <m>\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</m>
      represents the average rate of change in the position of the object over the
      interval <m>[t,t+h]</m>, which is also the average velocity of the object
      on this interval. Thus, the derivative
      <me>
        \vr'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}
      </me>
      is the
      instantaneous rate of change of <m>\vr(t)</m> at time <m>t</m> (for those values
      of <m>t</m> for which the limit exists), so <m>\vr'(t) = \vv(t)</m> is the
      instantaneous velocity of the object at time <m>t</m>. Furthermore, we can
      interpret the derivative <m>\vr'(t)</m> as the direction vector of the line
      tangent to the graph of <m>\vr</m> at the value <m>t</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly,
      <me>
        \vv'(t) = \vr''(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vv(t+h)-\vv(t)}{h}
      </me>
      is
      the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity of the object at time
      <m>t</m>, for those values of <m>t</m> for which the limits exists, and thus
      <m>\vv'(t) = \va(t)</m> is the acceleration of the moving object.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Note well:</em> Both the velocity and acceleration are <em>vector
      quantities</em>: they have magnitude and direction. By contrast, the
      magnitude of the velocity vector, <m>| \vv(t) |</m>, which is the <em>speed</em> of
      the object at time <m>t</m>, is a scalar quantity.

    <title>Computing Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives from
      the definition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the
      limit make it straightforward to calculate the derivative of a
      vector-valued function similar to how we developed
      shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I. To see why, recall that
      the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and that we can remove
      constant factors from limits. Thus, as we observed in a particular
      example in <xref ref="PA_9_7">Preview Activity</xref>, if <m>\vr(t) = x(t) \vi + y(t)
      \vj + z(t) \vk</m>, it follows that
      <md>
        <mrow>\vr'(t) = \mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow> = \mathstrut \amp \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[x(t+h)-x(t)] \vi + [y(t+h)-y(t)] \vj +
        [z(t+h)-z(t)] \vk}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow> = \mathstrut \amp \left(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}
        \right) \vi + \left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{y(t+h)-y(t)}{h} \right) \vj</mrow>
        <mrow> \mathstrut \amp  + \left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{z(t+h)-z(t)}{h} \right)\vk</mrow>
        <mrow>\mathstrut \amp = x'(t)\vi + y'(t) \vj + z'(t) \vk.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, we can calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function by
      simply differentiating its components.

      In first-semester calculus, we developed several important
      differentiation rules, including the constant multiple, product,
      quotient, and chain rules. For instance, recall that we formally
      state the product rule as
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f(x)\cdot g'(x) + g(x)\cdot f'(x).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions,
      including a product rule for scalar functions and vector-valued
      functions. These rules, which are easily verified, are summarized as
      follows.

      <em>Note well.</em> When applying these properties, use care to
      interpret the quantities involved as either scalars or vectors.
      For example, <m>\vr(t) \cdot \vs(t)</m> defines a scalar function
      because we have taken the dot product of two vector-valued functions.
      However, <m>\vr(t) \times \vs(t)</m> defines a vector-valued function since we

    <title>Tangent Lines</title>
    <p>
      One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a
      differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>: that is, when viewed
      up close, the curve generated by a differentiable function looks very
      much like a line. Indeed, when we zoom in sufficiently far on a
      particular point, the curve looks indistinguishable from its tangent
      line.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be
      locally linear. In the following activity, we investigate how to find
      the tangent line to such a curve. Recall from our work in
      <xref ref="S-9-5-Lines-Planes">Section</xref> that the vector equation of a line that
      passes through the point at the tip of the vector <m>\vL_0 = \langle
      x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vu = \langle
      a, b, c \rangle</m> can be written as
      <me>
        \vL(t) = \vL_0 + t \vu.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In parametric form, the line <m>\vL</m> is given by
      <me>

      We see that our work in <xref ref="A_9_7_4">Activity</xref> can be generalized.
      Given a differentiable vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>, the tangent
      line to the curve at the input value <m>a</m> is given by
      <men xml:id="E_TanLineVecFxn">
        \vL(t) = \vr(a) + t \vr'(a).
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here we see that because the tangent line is determined
      entirely by a given point and direction, the point is provided by the
      function <m>\vr</m>, evaluated at <m>t = a</m>, while the direction is
      provided by the derivative, <m>\vr'</m>, again evaluated at <m>t = a</m>.
      Note how analogous the formula for <m>\vL(t)</m> is to the tangent line
      approximation from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a
      given function <m>y = f(x)</m> at a value <m>x = a</m>, we found that the
      tangent line can be expressed by the linear function <m>y = L(x)</m> whose
      formula is
      <me>
        L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn"/> for the tangent line <m>\vL(t)</m> to the vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a single line, it is even possible to write the parameterization
      as
      <men xml:id="E_TanLineVecFxn2">
        \vL(t) = \vr(a) + (t-a)
        \vr'(a).
      </men>
      (For example, in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn"/>, <m>\vL(0) = \vr(a)</m>, so the line's parameterization <q>starts</q> at <m>t = 0</m>.  When we write the parameterization in the form of
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn2"/>, <m>\vL(a) = \vr(a)</m>, so the line's parameterization <q>starts</q> at <m>t = a</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      As we will learn more in Chapter 10, a smooth surface in 3-space is
      also locally linear. That means that the surface will look like a
      plane, which we call its <em>tangent plane</em>, as we zoom in on the
      graph. It is possible to use tangent lines to traces of the surface
      to generate a formula for the tangent plane; see

      satisfies <m>F'(x) = f(x)</m>. We then defined the indefinite integral
      <m>\int f(x) \ dx</m> to be the general antiderivative of <m>f</m>. Recall that
      the general antiderivative includes an added constant <m>C</m> in order to
      indicate that the general antiderivative is in fact an entire family
      of functions. We can do the similar work with vector-valued functions.

      The same reasoning that allows us to differentiate a vector-valued
      function componentwise applies to integrating as well. Recall that the
      integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals and also that we can
      remove constant factors from integrals. So, given <m>{\vr(t) = x(t) \vi
      + y(t) \vj + z(t) \vk}</m>, it follows that we can integrate
      componentwise. Expressed more formally,

      In light of being able to integrate and differentiate componentwise
      with vector-valued functions, we can solve many problems that are
      analogous to those we encountered in single-variable calculus. For
      instance, recall problems where we were given an object moving along
      an axis with velocity function <m>v</m> and an initial position <m>s(0)</m>.
      In that context, we were able to differentiate <m>v</m> in order to find
      acceleration, and integrate <m>v</m> and use the initial condition in order
      to find the position function <m>s</m>. In the following activity, we
      explore similar ideas with vector-valued functions.

    <title>Projectile Motion</title>
    <p>
      Any time that an object is launched into the air with a given velocity
      and launch angle, the path the object travels is determined almost
      exclusively by the force of gravity. Whether in sports such as
      archery or shotput, in military applications with artillery, or in
      important fields like firefighting, it is important to be able to know
      when and where a launched projectile will land. We can use our
      knowledge of vector-valued functions in order to completely determine
      the path traveled by an object that is launched from a given position
      at a given angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_9_7_Motion">
      <caption>Projectile motion.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/fig_9_7_projectile"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Assume we fire a projectile from a launcher and the only force acting
      on the fired object is the force of gravity pulling down on the
      object. That is, we assume no effect due to spin, wind, or air
      resistance. With these assumptions, the motion of the object will be
      planar, so we can also assume that the motion occurs in
      two-dimensional space. Suppose we launch the object from an initial
      position <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> at an angle <m>\theta</m> with the positive <m>x</m>-axis
      as illustrated in <xref ref="F_9_7_Motion">Figure</xref>, and that we fire the
      object with an initial speed of <m>v_0 = |\vv(0)|</m>, where <m>\vv(t)</m> is
      the velocity vector of the object at time <m>t</m>. Assume <m>g</m> is the
      positive constant acceleration force due to gravity, which acts to
      pull the fired object toward the ground (in the negative <m>y</m>
      direction). Note particularly that there is no external force acting
      on the object to move it in the <m>x</m> direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We first observe that since gravity only acts in the downward
      direction and that the acceleration due to gravity is constant,
      the acceleration vector is <m>\langle 0, -g
      \rangle</m>. That is, <m>\va(t) = \langle 0, -g \rangle</m>. We may use this
      fact about acceleration, together with the initial position and
      initial velocity in order to fully determine the position <m>\vr(t)</m> of the object at time <m>t</m>. In <xref ref="Ez_9_7_5">Exercise</xref>, you
      can work through the details to show that the following general
      formula holds.

                We will need to find values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that <m>a+1=b^2</m>,
                <m>\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} a\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}b\right)</m>,
                and <m>\frac{1}{1+a} = b</m>.
                The first equation tells us that <m>a = b^2-1</m>.
                Substituting into the third equation results in
                <me>
                  \frac{1}{1+b^2-1} = \frac{1}{b^2} = b

                This equation is satisfied when <m>b^3=1</m> or when <m>b=1</m>.
                This makes <m>a=0</m>.
                Note that the second equation is also satisfied when <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=1</m>.
                So the point of intersection of the curves occurs when <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=1</m>,
                which produces the point <m>(1, 1,1)</m>.

                  Use the given information about initial speed and launch angle to find <m>\vv_0</m>, the initial velocity of the projectile.  You will want to write the vector in terms of its components, which will involve <m>\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta)</m>.

            A <em>central force</em> is one that
            acts on an object so that the force <m>\vF</m> is parallel to the
            object's position <m>\vr</m>. Since Newton's Second Law says that an
            object's acceleration is proportional to the force exerted on it,
            the acceleration <m>\va</m> of an object moving under a central force
            will be parallel to its position <m>\vr</m>. For instance, the Earth's
            acceleration due to the
            gravitational force that the sun exerts on the Earth is parallel to
            the Earth's position vector as shown in <xref ref="F_9_7_sun">Figure</xref>.

                Since the acceleration is parallel to the position under a central force,

                Since the derivative of <m>\vL</m> is <m>\vzero</m>,
