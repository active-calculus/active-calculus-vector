    <introduction>
    <!-- <p>
      A vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> determines a curve in space as the
      collection of terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If the curve is
      smooth, it is natural to ask whether <m>\vr(t)</m> has a derivative. In
      the same way, our experiences with integrals in single-variable
      calculus prompt us to wonder what the integral of a vector-valued
      function might be and what it might tell us. We
      explore both of these questions in detail in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, let's recall some important ideas from calculus I. Given a
      function <m>s</m> that measures the position of an object moving along
      an axis, its derivative, <m>s'</m>, is defined by
      <me>
        s'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(t+h) - s(t)}{h},
      </me>
      and measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>s</m> with respect to
      time. In particular, for a fixed value <m>t = a</m>, <m>s'(a)</m> measures the
      velocity of the moving object, as well as the slope of the tangent
      line to the curve <m>y = s(t)</m> at the point <m>(a,s(a))</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we work with vector-valued functions, we will strive to update
      these ideas and perspectives into the context of curves in space and
      outputs that are vectors.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      In your first calculus course you looked at what was measured by the new operations of limits, derivatives, and integrals. Each of these ideas and its applications was likely introduced as a way to measure something specific by approximating the measurement and then looking at how to improve this approximation. Limits offered a powerful tool to precisely describe how these approximations would converge to the relevant measurement. This is the classic calculus approach: 1) approximate the measurement, 2) quantify how the approximation changes on a finer scale, and 3) use a limit to show how the approximate calculus converge to the measurement of interest. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this course, we will use this structure to investigate properties of new kinds of functions, equations, and graphs. In this section, we want to investigate the meaning of limits, derivatives, and integrals on our new class of functions, vector valued functions of one variable. Additionally, we will connect these measurements to properties of curves in space as the graphs of these vector valued functions. As we expand our perspective and scope of study, you will likely see deeper meanings in the definitions of limits, derivative, and integrals from your first calculus course.

          As the only employee of <em>Steer Clear</em>, you have decided that you need to understand how the timing of position measurements will change different measurements needed for your self driving car. You decide to drive in a figure eight path described by <m>\vr_8(t)=\langle \cos(t),\sin(2t) \rangle </m> for <m>0 \leq t \leq 2 \pi</m>. A plot of this path is given in <xref ref="PA-vvfcalc1" />.

      In <xref ref="vvf-limitPA" />, we examined what the limit of a vector valued function will look like; specifically, the limit of a vector valued function (of one variable) has the same meaning as in your first calculus course. The limit of a function is a measure of what the output approaches as the input gets closer to a particular value. We will not state the formal version of limits of vector valued functions of one variable, but rather will appeal to the very important idea that limits can be defined and calculated componentwise. If <m>\vr(t)=\langle x_1(t),\ldots,x_n(t)\rangle</m>, then the limit of <m>\vr</m> as <m>t\rightarrow a</m> exists if all of the limits <m>x_i(t)</m> exist as <m>t\rightarrow a</m>. In other words, the limit of a vector valued function of one variable is the same as the limits of the <m>n</m> component functions organized as a vector.

    <title>The Derivative</title>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, <m>f'</m>, of a given function <m>f</m> by
      <me>
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},
      </me>
      provided the limit exists. At a given value of <m>a</m>, <m>f'(a)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m>, and also tells us the slope of the tangent line to the curve <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a, f(a))</m>. The definition of the derivative extends naturally to vector-valued functions and curves in space.

      Both the velocity and acceleration are <em>vector quantities</em>: they have magnitude and direction. By contrast, the magnitude of the velocity vector, <m>\Vert \vv(t) \Vert</m>, which is the <term>speed</term> of the object at time <m>t</m>, is a scalar quantity.

    <title>Computing Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives using the definition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the
      limits and vectors make it straightforward to calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function similar to how we developed shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I. If we breakdown the steps in <xref ref="vvf-derivative-defn" /> we notice that
      <ol>
        <li>vector subtraction (<m>\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)</m>) </li>
        <li>scalar multiplication (multiply by <m>\frac{1}{h}</m>) </li>
        <li>evaluate limit as <m>h\rightarrow 0</m> </li>
      </ol>
      are all evaluated componentwise on our vector valued function. Thus we can apply our derivative rules on each component of <m>\vr(t)</m> to compute the derivative <m>\frac{d\vr}{dt}</m>.

            <mrow> = \mathstrut \amp \left(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}
            \right) \vi + \left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{y(t+h)-y(t)}{h} \right) \vj</mrow>

    In first-semester calculus, we developed several important differentiation rules, including the constant multiple, product, quotient, and chain rules. For instance, recall that we formally state the product rule as
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)  g(x)] = f(x) g'(x) + g(x) f'(x).
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions, including a product rules for each of the kinds of multiplication we have defined involving vectors. These rules, which are easily verified, are summarized as follows.

    When applying these properties, pay attention to whether the quantities involved as either scalars or vectors. For example, <m>\vr(t) \cdot \vs(t)</m> defines a scalar function because we have taken the dot product of two vector-valued functions. However, <m>\vr(t) \times \vs(t)</m> defines a vector-valued function since we have taken the cross product of two vector-valued functions.

  <p>
    In the next several sections of this chapter, we will examine how to utilize the calculus tools above and vector measurements to calculate different properties of curves in space and the associated velocity and acceleration vectors that come from their parameterizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think the elements of the next activity are done other places in developing the splitting of acceleration. I think the calculation portions can be folded into the tangent line activity.

  <title>Tangent Lines</title>
  <p>
    One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>: that is, when viewed up close, the curve generated by a differentiable function looks very much like a line. Indeed, when we zoom in sufficiently far on a particular point, the curve looks indistinguishable from its tangent line. You can look at <xref ref="LLline" /> at the beginning of <xref ref="S-Precalc-Lines" /> for an interactive visualization of this idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be locally linear. In <xref ref="A_9_7_4" />, we investigate how to find the tangent line to such a curve. Recall from our work in <xref ref="S-Precalc-Lines">Section</xref> that the vector equation of a line that passes through the point at the tip of the vector <m>\vL_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vu = \langle a, b, c \rangle</m> can be written as
    <me>
      \vL(t) = \vL_0 + t \vu.
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In parametric form, the line <m>\vL</m> is given by
    <me>
      x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ z(t) = z_0 + ct.

    We see that our work in <xref ref="A_9_7_4">Activity</xref> can be generalized. Given a differentiable vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>, the tangent line to the curve at the input value <m>a</m> is given by
    <men xml:id="E_TanLineVecFxn">
      \vL(t) = \vr(a) + t \vr'(a).
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we see that because the tangent line is determined entirely by a given point and direction, the point is provided by the function <m>\vr</m>, evaluated at <m>t = a</m>, while the direction is provided by the derivative, <m>\vr'</m>, again evaluated at <m>t = a</m>. Note how analogous the formula for <m>\vL(t)</m> is to the tangent line approximation from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a given function <m>y = f(x)</m> at a value <m>x = a</m>, we found that the tangent line can be expressed by the linear function <m>y = L(x)</m> whose
    formula is
    <me>
      L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a).
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn"/> for the tangent line <m>\vL(t)</m> to the vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a single line, it is even possible to write the parameterization
    as
    <men xml:id="E_TanLineVecFxn2">
      \vL(t) = \vr(a) + (t-a)
      \vr'(a).
    </men>
    (For example, in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn"/>, <m>\vL(0) = \vr(a)</m>, so the line's parameterization <q>starts</q> at <m>t = 0</m>.  When we write the parameterization in the form of Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn2"/>, <m>\vL(a) = \vr(a)</m>, so the line's parameterization <q>starts</q> at <m>t = a</m>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    As we will learn in <xref ref="C_MVF" />, a smooth surface in 3-space is also locally linear. That means that the surface will look like a plane, which we call its <em>tangent plane</em>, as we zoom in on the graph. It is possible to use tangent lines to traces of the surface to generate a formula for the tangent plane; see <xref ref="Ez_9_7_3">Exercise</xref> for more details.

  <title>Integrating a Vector-Valued Function</title>
  <p>
    Recall from your calculus of scalar valued functions, that the definite integral of a function <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is defined as 
    <me>
      \int_a^b f(x)  \  dx=lim_{\Delta x_i \rightarrow 0} \sum_{i=0}^n f(x^*_i) \Delta x_i
    </me>
    Where <m>\Delta x_i</m> is the width of the interval from <m>[x_{i-1},x_i]</m> and <m>x^*_i</m> is some point in <m>[x_{i-1},x_i]</m>. The definite integral measure the (signed) area between the graph of <m>f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m>. The definite integral follows our classic calculus approach to measure the accumulation of the output of <m>f</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Most students never used this Riemann sum definition to calculate any definite integrals, rather they used the Fundamental Therom of Calculus and the associated antiderivatives to efficiently calculate the value of a definite integral. <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-4-4-FTC.html#FTC" /> states that if <m>f</m> is a continuous function on <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>F(x)</m> is an antiderivatve of f (<m>\frac{dF}{dx}=f(x)</m>), then 
    <me> \int_a^b f(x)  \  dx = F(b)-F(a)</me>
    The set of functions that are the antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> is also called the indefinite integral of <m>f(x)</m> and is denoted <m>\int f(x)  \  dx</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We can apply all of the ideas above related to definite and indefinite integrals to vector valued functions of one variable by performing each operation separately on each component (apply integration componentwise).  Thus we

    The area under the curve idea does NOT generalize when we think about the integral of <m>\vr(t)</m>. The integral of <m>\vr</m> is in relation to the variable <m>t</m> and there is not a <m>t</m>-axis on the graph of <m>\vr(t)</m>. need to think this explanation through more...
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept that the definite integral measures the accumulation of the output of your function will generalize to the vector valued function realm. Recall that if <m>v(t)</m> was the velocity of an object traveling on the <m>x</m>-axis, then we could describe the position of the object as 
    <me>
      x(t)=\int_0^t v(u)  \  du + x_0
    </me>
    This was the result of setting up a Riemann sum that looked at the change in position over a small step of time as the velocity on that step times the size of the time step. In other words, 
    <me>
      x(t)\approx x_0 + \sum_{i=0}{n} v(t^*_i) \Delta t_i 
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Applying this accumulation of rates of change or velocity ideas componentwise means that if we are able to separate the velocity of our motion into components, then we can integrate (componentwise!) to get the position in terms of each coordinate separately! Additionally, we can integrate acceleration to get the velocity as a function of <m>t</m>. Whether we are integrating velocity to get position or acceleration to get velocity, it will be necessary to have a particular point (in position or velocity) that will us to solve for the particular integration constant (the <m>+C</m>).
  </p>
  <example xml:id="projectilemotion">
    <p>
      For this example, we will look at the motion of a projectile in two dimensions where the only force on the projectile is gravity. This type of problem applies to sports like archery or shotput or to military applications like mortar or artillery placements, as well applications to firefighting or fireworks construction. This kind of simplified physics problem is common in introductory courses because there is only one force involved, the force is constant (does not change based on location, speed, or time), and the force is in only one coordinate direction. Even this description is a greatly simplified version of how gravity acts in a greater sense. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton's second law of motion says that that sum of the forces acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration vector. In our problem, the only force is gravity pulling the object in the negative <m>y</m>-direction. In our example, we will try to completely determine the path traveled by an object that is launched from a fixed position at a given angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity. This information can be stated as follows: 
      <ul>
        <li>the acceleration is given by <m>m \va(t) = -mg \vj</m> (the only force is gravity pulling down with a constant force)</li>
        <li>the initial position is <m> \vr(0)=\langle x_0,y_0\rangle </m></li>
        <li>the initial velocity is <m>\vv(0)=\frac{\vr}{dt}(0)=\langle v_0 \cos(\theta),v_0 \sin(\theta) \rangle</m></li>
      </ul>

      <caption>Projectile motion</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/fig_9_7_projectile"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We can simplify <m>m \va(t) = -mg \vj</m> to get <m>\va(t)=\langle 0,-g\rangle</m>, then integrate acceleration to get the velocity as a function of <m>t</m>. The indefinite integral of <m>\va(t)=\langle 0,-g\rangle</m> with respect to <m>t</m> will be <m>\langle 0,-gt\rangle +\vec{C}</m>, where <m>\vec{C}</m> is some constant vector. We need to pick the constant such that the initial velocity is <m>\vv(0)\langle v_0 \cos(\theta),v_0 \sin(\theta) \rangle</m>, so we will have 
      <me>
        \vv(t)=\langle 0,-gt\rangle+\langle v_0 \cos(\theta),v_0 \sin(\theta) \rangle=\langle v_0 \cos(\theta),v_0 \sin(\theta)-gt \rangle
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can integrate our velocity function to get the position as a function of <m>t</m>. The indefinite integral of <m>\langle v_0 \cos(\theta),v_0 \sin(\theta)-gt \rangle</m> will be 
      <me>
        \langle v_0 \cos(\theta) t ,v_0 \sin(\theta)t- \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \rangle+ \vec{C}
      </me>
      Again we need to pick the integration constant, <m>\vec{C}</m>, that satisifes our initial position <m> \vr(0)=\langle x_0,y_0\rangle </m>. This gives the following vector valued function for the position of the object as a function of time.
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \left\langle v_0 \cos(\theta)t + x_0, -\frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_0 \sin(\theta)t + y_0 \right\rangle
      </me>

    In the next activity, we will look at relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration in a situation that is more complicated than the constant acceleration of <xref ref="projectilemotion" />. The process of using integration and differentiation will remain the same but the results will not be nearly as simple.
