    <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the
      graph of a differentiable function, when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a
      line. We call this line the tangent line and measure its slope with
      the derivative. In this section, we will extend this concept to
      functions of several variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's see what happens when we look
      at the graph of a two-variable function on a small scale. To begin, let's consider the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = 6 - \frac{x^2}2 - y^2,
      </me>
      whose graph is shown in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_4_tangent_1">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_1"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point <m>(x_0,
      y_0) = (1,1)</m>. In particular, we wish to view the graph on an
      increasingly small scale around this point, as shown in the two plots in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_2">Figure</xref>
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_4_tangent_2">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2</m>.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
      <image source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_2"/>
      <image source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_3"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a line
      when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable
      function looks like a plane, as seen in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_4">Figure</xref>.
      In the following preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this plane.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_4_tangent_4">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_4"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In what follows, we will also use the important fact<fn>As we saw in <xref ref="S-9-5-Lines-Planes">Section</xref>, the equation
        of a plane passing through the point <m>(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> may be written
        in the form <m>A(x-x_0) + B(y-y_0) + C(z-z_0) = 0</m>.  If the
        plane is not vertical, then <m>C\neq 0</m>, and we can
        rearrange this and hence write
      <m>C(z-z_0) = -A(x-x_0) - B(y-y_0)</m>
      and thus
      <md>
        <mrow>z \amp  = z_0-\frac AC(x-x_0) - \frac BC(y-y_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = z_0 + a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0)</mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>a=-A/C</m> and <m>b=-B/C</m>, respectively.</fn> that the plane passing through <m>(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> may be expressed in the form
      <m>z = z_0 + a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0)</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants.

    <title>The Tangent Plane</title>
    <p>
      Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for a general function <m>f=f(x,y)</m>, we need to discuss a technical
      condition. As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable
      function on a small scale near a point <m>x_0</m>, we expect to see a line;
      in this case, we say that <em><m>f</m> is locally linear near <m>x_0</m></em> since the graph looks like a linear function locally around <m>x_0</m>. Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by <m>f(x)=|x|</m>, that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function <em><m>f</m> is locally linear<idx><h>function</h><h>locally linear</h></idx> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m></em> provided that the graph of <m>f</m> looks like a plane (its <em>tangent plane</em>) when viewed on a small scale near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. How can we tell when a function of two variables is locally linear at a point?
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not unreasonable to expect that if <m>f_x(a,b)</m> and <m>f_y(a,b)</m> exist for some function <m>f</m> at a point <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is locally linear at <m>(a,b)</m>. This is not sufficient, however. As an example, consider the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x^{1/3} y^{1/3}</m>. In <xref ref="Ez_10_4_0">Exercise</xref> you are asked to show that <m>f_x(0,0)</m> and <m>f_y(0,0)</m> both exist, but that <m>f</m> is not locally linear at <m>(0,0)</m> (see <xref ref="F_10_4_Not_diff">Figure</xref>). So the existence of the two first order partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee local linearity at that point. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It would take us too far afield to provide a rigorous dicussion of differentiability of functions of more than one variable (see <xref ref="Ez_10_4_4">Exercise</xref> for a little more detail), so we will be content to define stronger, but more easily verified, conditions that ensure local linearity. 
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="Differentiablity">
      <title>Differentiablity</title>
    <p>
      If <m>f</m> is a function of the independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and both <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>f</m> is <em>continuously differentiable</em><idx><h>function</h><h>continuously differentiable</h></idx> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
    </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      As a consequence, whenever a function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> is continuously differentiable at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, it follows that the function has a tangent plane at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually indistinguishable. (We won't formally define differentiability of multivariable functions here, and for our purposes continuous differentiability is the only condition we will ever need to use. It is important to note that continuous differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to continuously differentiable functions.)  In addition, as in <xref ref="PA_10_4">Preview Activity</xref>, we find the following general formula for the tangent plane. 
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="Tangent-plane">
      <title>The tangent plane</title>
    <p>
      If <m>f(x,y)</m> has continuous first-order partial derivatives, then the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))</m> is
      <men xml:id="eq_10_4_tan_plane">
        z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
      </men>
    </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
        <em>Important Note:</em> As can be seen in <xref ref="Ez_10_4_0">Exercise</xref>, it is possible that <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> can exist for a function <m>f</m>, and so the plane <m>z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m> exists even though <m>f</m> is not locally linear at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> (because the graph of <m>f</m> does not look linear when we zoom in around the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>). In such a case this plane is not tangent to the graph. Differentiability for a function of two variables implies the existence of a tangent plane, but the existence of the two first order partial derivatives of a function at a point does not imply differentiaility. This is quite different than what happens in single variable calculus. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent plane, <m>z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m>. Say, for example, that we have the particular tangent plane <m>z = 7 - 2(x-3) + 4(y+1)</m>. Observe that we can immediately read from this form that <m>f_x(3,-1) = -2</m> and <m>f_y(3,-1) = 4</m>; furthermore, <m>f_x(3,-1)=-2</m> is the slope of the trace to both <m>f</m> and the tangent plane in the <m>x</m>-direction at <m>(3,-1)</m>. In the same way, <m>f_y(3,-1) = 4</m> is the slope of the trace of both <m>f</m> and the tangent plane in the <m>y</m>-direction at <m>(3,-1)</m>.

    <title>Linearization</title>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is
      to approximate the value of a differentiable function. Near the point <m>x_0</m>, the
      tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x_0</m> is close to the
      graph of <m>f</m> near <m>x_0</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F_10_4_2d_linear">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_4_2d_linear">
      <caption>The linearization of the single-variable function <m>f(x)</m>.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
      <image source="images/fig_10_4_2d_linear"/>
      <image source="images/fig_10_4_2d_linear_gray"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In this single-variable setting, we let <m>L</m> denote the function whose graph is the tangent line, and thus
      <me>
        L(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, observe that <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> near <m>x_0</m>. We call <m>L</m> the
      <em>linearization</em> of <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> at a point
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provides a good approximation of <m>f(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,
      y_0)</m>. Here, we define the linearization, <m>L</m>, to be the two-variable function whose
      graph is the tangent plane, and thus
      <me>
        L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +
        f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, note that <m>f(x,y)\approx L(x,y)</m> for points near <m>(x_0,
      y_0)</m>. This is illustrated in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_9">Figure</xref>.

    <title>Differentials</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen, the linearization <m>L(x,y)</m> enables us to estimate the value of <m>f(x,y)</m> for points <m>(x,y)</m> near the base point
      <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>.
      Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the <em>change</em> in <m>f</m> as we move from the base point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to another
      point <m>(x,y)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_10_4_differential">
      <caption>The differential <m>df</m> approximates the change in
          <m>f(x,y)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_10"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      <xref ref="F_10_4_differential">Figure</xref> illustrates this situation. Suppose
      we are at the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, and we know the value <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> of <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. If we consider the displacement <m>\langle \Delta x, \Delta
      y\rangle</m> to a new point <m>(x,y) = (x_0+\Delta x, y_0
      + \Delta y)</m>, we would like to know how much the function has changed.
      We denote this change by <m>\Delta f</m>, where
      <me>
        \Delta f = f(x,y) - f(x_0, y_0).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple way to estimate the change <m>\Delta f</m> is to approximate it by
      <m>df</m>, which represents the change in the linearization <m>L(x,y)</m> as we move from
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m>. This gives
      <md>
        <mrow>\Delta f \approx df \amp = L(x,y)-f(x_0, y_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = [f(x_0,y_0)+ f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +
          f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)] - f(x_0, y_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = f_x(x_0,y_0)\Delta x + f_y(x_0, y_0)\Delta y.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      For consistency, we will denote the
      change in the independent variables as <m>dx = \Delta x</m> and <m>dy =
      \Delta y</m>, and thus
      <men xml:id="E_10_4_differential">
        \Delta f \approx df = f_x(x_0,y_0)~dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)~dy.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have
      <men xml:id="E_10_4_differential_leib">
        df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}~dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial
            y}~dy.

      We call the quantities <m>dx</m>, <m>dy</m>, and <m>df</m> <em>differentials</em><idx><h>differentials</h></idx>, and we think of them as measuring small changes in the quantities <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>f</m>. Equations <xref ref="E_10_4_differential"/>
      and <xref ref="E_10_4_differential_leib"/> express the
      relationship between these changes. Equation
      <xref ref="E_10_4_differential_leib"/> resembles an important idea
      from single-variable calculus: when <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>,
      it follows in the notation of differentials that
      <me>
        dy = y'~dx = \frac{dy}{dx}~dx.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We will illustrate the use of differentials with an
      example. 
    </p>

      <example>
      <p>
      Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles of
      width <m>x=20</m> cm and height <m>y=10</m> cm. However, the machine isn't perfect, and therefore the width could be off by <m>dx = \Delta x = 0.2</m> cm and the height could be off by <m>dy = \Delta y = 0.4</m> cm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area of the rectangle is
      <me>
        A(x,y) = xy,
      </me>
      so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is <m>A(20, 10) =
      200</m> square centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would
      like to know how much the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the
      perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using
      <xref ref="E_10_4_differential"/>, and find that
      <me>
        \Delta A \approx dA = A_x(20, 10)~dx + A_y(20,10)~dy.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>A_x = y</m> and <m>A_y = x</m>, we have
      <me>
        \Delta A \approx dA = 10~dx + 20~dy = 10\cdot0.2 + 20\cdot0.4 = 10.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by
      as much as 10 square centimeters.

                Suppose that the elevation of a landscape is given by the

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables is locally linear at
            a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> if the graph of <m>f</m> looks like a plane 
            as we zoom in on the graph around the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.  In this
            case, the equation of the tangent plane is given by
          <me>
            z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The tangent plane <m>L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m>, when considered as a function, is
            called the linearization of a differentiable function <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and may be used
            to estimate values of <m>f(x,y)</m>;  that is, <m>f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)</m>
            for points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that both <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> exist and are continuous in an open disk containing 
          the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The differential <m>df</m> of a function <m>f= f(x,y)</m> is related to the
            differentials <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> by
          <me>
            df = f_x(x_0,y_0) dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)dy.
          </me>
          We can use this relationship to
            approximate small changes in <m>f</m> that result from small changes in
            <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

                  Just as we can find a local linearization for a differentiable function of two variables, we can do so for functions of three or more variables.  By extending the concept of the local linearization from two to three variables, find the linearization of the function <m>h(x,y,z) =
                    e^{2x}(y+z^2)</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0) = (0, 1, -2)</m>.  Then, use the

                  Resistors used in electrical circuits have colored bands painted
                    on them to indicate the amount of resistance and the possible error
                    in the resistance.  When three resistors, whose resistances are
                    <m>R_1</m>, <m>R_2</m>, and <m>R_3</m>, are connected in parallel, the total
                    resistance <m>R</m> is given by
                  <me>
                    \frac1R = \frac1{R_1} + \frac1{R_2} + \frac1{R_3}.
                  </me>
                  Suppose that the resistances are <m>R_1=25\Omega</m>, <m>R_2=40\Omega</m>, and
                    <m>R_3=50\Omega</m>.  Find the total resistance <m>R</m>.

                    If you know each of <m>R_1</m>, <m>R_2</m>, and <m>R_3</m> with a possible error of
                    <m>0.5</m>%, estimate the maximum error in your calculation of <m>R</m>.

            In this section we argued that if <m>f = f(x,y)</m> is a function of two variables and if <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> both exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. This condition ensures that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, but it does not define what it means for <m>f</m> to be differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this exercise we explore the definition of differentiability of a function of two variables in more detail. Throughout, let <m>g</m> be the function defined by <m>g(x,y)=  \sqrt{|xy|}</m>.

                  Recall that if a function <m>f = f(x)</m> of a single variable is differentiable at <m>x=x_0</m>, then 
                  <me>f'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}</me>
                  exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of <m>f'(x_0)</m> means that the graph of <m>f</m> is locally linear at <m>x=x_0</m>. In other words, the graph of <m>f</m> looks like its linearization <m>L(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>x_0</m>. That is, the values of <m>f(x)</m> can be closely approximated by <m>L(x)</m> as long as <m>x</m> is close to <m>x_0</m>. We can measure how good the approximation of <m>L(x)</m> is to <m>f(x)</m> with the error function 
                  <me>E(x) = L(x) - f(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0) - f(x).</me>
                  As <m>x</m> approaches <m>x_0</m>, <m>E(x)</m> approaches <m>f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(0) - f(x_0) = 0</m>, and so <m>L(x)</m> provides increasingly better approximations to <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer to <m>x_0</m>. 

                  Show that, even though <m>g(x,y) = \sqrt{|xy|}</m> is not locally linear at <m>(0,0)</m>, its error term
                  <me>E(x,y) = L(x,y) - g(x,y)</me>
                  at <m>(0,0)</m> has a limit of <m>0</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m>. (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to <m>0</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to <m>0</m> does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider <m>f = f(x)</m> as a function of one variable. If we let <m>x = x_0+h</m>, where <m>|h|</m> is the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>x_0</m>, then the relative error in approximating <m>f(x_0+h)</m> with <m>L(x_0+h)</m> is  
                  <me>\frac{E(x_0+h)}{h}.</me>
                  Show that, for a function <m>f = f(x)</m> of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is <m>0</m> as <m>h</m> approaches <m>0</m>.  

                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of <m>0</m> at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then if <m>x = x_0+h</m> and <m>y = y_0+k</m>, the distance from <m>(x,y)</m> to <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{h^2+k^2}</m>.

                We want to verify that the limit of <m>\frac{E(0 + h, 0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}}</m> does not exist at <m>(h, k) = (0, 0)</m>. Note that 
                <me>
                  \frac{E(0 + h, 0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = \frac{L(0 + h, 0 + k) - g(0 + h, 0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = \frac{0 - g(h, k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} 
                </me>, 
                so  
                <me>
                  \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{E(0 + h, 0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{-\sqrt{\vert hk \vert}}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} 
                </me>.
                Taking the limit along the path <m>h=0</m> yields 
                <me>
                  \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{- \sqrt{0}}{\sqrt{k^2}} = 0
                </me>.
                However, taking the limit along the path <m>h = k</m> yields 
                <me>
                  \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{- \sqrt{\vert k^2 \vert }}{\sqrt{2k^2}} = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
                </me>.
                Since the limits along different paths are not equal, the limit does not exist. Note that more generally, we could consider the limit along the linear path <m>h = ck</m> for some constant <m>c</m>. Then we have 
                <me>
                  \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{- \sqrt{\vert ck^2 \vert }}{\sqrt{c^2k^2 + k^2}} = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{- \sqrt{\vert c \vert }}{\sqrt{c^2 + 1}}
                </me>.
                This limit has different values for different values of <m>c</m>, so again we see that the limit does not exist.

                From the graph, it appears that the surface comes to a sharp point at <m>(0,0)</m> and thus is not locally linear - no matter how much we zoom in, the surface will have a sharp corner and will not look like a plane.

            We know <m>\lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} (mh + nk) = 0</m>, so we have

        <solution>
          <p>
            Assume <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>. Then by definition 
            <me>
              \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{E(x_0 + h, y_0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = 0
            </me>,
            so we have   
            <md>
              <mrow> 0  \amp = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - L(x_0 + h, y_0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - (f(x_0, y_0) + m(x - x_0) + n(y - y_0) )}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) + mh + nk}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} </mrow>
            </md>. 
            Multiply both sides by <m>\lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \sqrt{h^2 + k^2}</m> to get 
            <md>
              <mrow> 0 \amp = \left (\lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \sqrt{h^2 + k^2} \right ) \left ( \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) + mh + nk}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} \right)</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0) } \left(f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) + mh + nk \right ) </mrow>
            </md>.
            We know <m>\lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} (mh + nk) = 0</m>, so we have 
            <md>
              <mrow> \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \left(f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) \right )\amp = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} \left((x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) + (mh + nk) - (mh + nk) \right )</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)}\left(f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) + mh + nk 
              \right ) - \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} (mh + nk) </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 0 - 0 </mrow>  
              <mrow> \amp = 0 </mrow>
            </md>.
            Thus  
            <me>
              \lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) = f(x_0, y_0)
            </me>
            and so <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>.
