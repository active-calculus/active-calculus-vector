  <exercise xml:id="ez_Vector_StokesThm_potential">
    <introduction>
      <p><xref ref="thm_Stokes" text="title"/> is generally used to
      turn a line integral into a flux integral. Sometimes it is
      possible to be given a flux integral and recognize that the
      given vector field <m>\vF</m> is <m>\curl(\vG)</m> for some
      vector field <m>\vG</m>, however. When this is the case, we call
      <m>\vG</m> a <term>vector potential</term> for the vector field
      <m>\vF</m>, much like a function <m>f</m> so that <m>\vF =
      \grad(f)</m> is called a potential function for <m>\vF</m>.</p>
    </introduction>
    <task xml:id="task_Vector_StokesThm_potential_find">
      <statement>
	<p>Find a vector field <m>\vF</m> so that <m>\curl(\vF) =
	\langle x-y^2,4xy-y-4,-4xz\rangle</m>.</p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
	<p>Your experience in finding potential functions for gradient
	vector fields will be useful to you here, although you will
	have more flexibility.</p>
      </hint>
    </task>
    <task xml:id="task_Vector_StokesThm_potential_find2">
      <statement>
	<p>When finding an anti-derivative of a function of a single
	variable, you know that there is an infinite family of
	anti-derivatives, but that any two anti-derivatives differ by a
	constant. This is why we write expressions such as
	<m>\displaystyle\int\cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x) + C</m>. A similar
	phenomenon occurs with (scalar) potential functions for
	gradient vector fields. Find a <em>second</em> vector field
	<m>\vG</m> with the same curl as in <xref ref="task_Vector_StokesThm_potential_find" text="local">part</xref>, and do so in a way that
	<m>\vF-\vG</m> is <em>not</em> a constant vector. That is,
	after simplifying fully, <m>\vF-\vG</m> must contain at least
	one of the variables <m>x,y,z</m>.</p>
      </statement>
    </task>
    <task xml:id="task_Vector_StokesThm_potential_gradient">
      <statement>
	<p>Verify that for the vector fields you found above,
	<m>\vF-\vG</m> is a gradient vector field. Explain why for
	<em>every</em> pair <m>\vF, \vG</m> of vector potentials for a
	vector field <m>\vH</m>, you must have that <m>\vF-\vG</m> is
	a gradient vector field.

      <statement>
	<p>Explain why if <m>\vH</m> is a vector field with a vector
	potential <m>\vF</m>, <m>\divg(\vH) = 0</m>. Such a vector
	field is called a <term>solenoidal vector field</term> or
	<term>divergence-free vector field</term>.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Repeat the steps of <xref ref="verifyStokespart2" /> and <xref ref="verifyStokespart3" /> with the surface <m>z=x^4-y^4</m> to verify Stokes' Theorem for another different surface. Your flux integral should calculate to <m>-\pi</m> as in <xref ref="verifyStokes" />.
