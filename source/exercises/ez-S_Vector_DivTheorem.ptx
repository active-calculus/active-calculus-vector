          Let <m>Q</m> be the volume enclosed by <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=1</m>, <m>y=0</m>, <m>y=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>, and <m>z=1</m>. Compute the flux of <m>\vF = \langle z^2-xy,4yz+cos(x/\pi),e^{xyz} \rangle</m> through each of the six cube faces.

        The triple integral calculation would be

          \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (-y+4z+xye^{xyz}) \, dz \, dy \, dx =\frac{1}{2}+(1-e)^2

        Let <m>Q</m> be the volume given in cylindrical coordinates by <m>0 \leq z \leq 3</m>, <m>1 \leq r \leq 2</m>, and <m>0 \leq \theta \lt 2 \pi</m>. Give an example of a vector field with component functions that are linear in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> such that the flux of the vector field through the boundary of <m>Q</m> is 17.

      <p>
        <m>\vF=\langle x,-y,\frac{25}{9\pi} z \rangle</m>
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If <m>\vF=\langle x,-y,\frac{25}{9\pi} z \rangle</m>, then <m>\divg(\vF)= 1-1+\frac{25}{9\pi}</m>. Since we have a constant divergence and the volume of the region is <m>9\pi</m>, the triple integral of the divergence over the region will result in 25.

      <p>Let <m>Q</m> be the volume given in spherical coordinates by <m> 0 \leq \rho \leq 3</m>, <m>0\leq \phi \leq \pi/4</m>, and <m>0\leq \theta \lt 2 \pi</m>. Give an example of a vector field with component functions that are not linear or constant such that the flux of the vector field through the boundary of <m>Q</m> is 25.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>Calculate the flux of the given vector field <m>\vF</m> through the surface <m>S</m> for each situation below by using an appropriate triple integral from the Divergence Theorem.</p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
	      <p>
          The vector field <m>\vF = \langle 2x+3\sin(yz),-4y+e^{x^2} , 7z+\arctan(y^5)</m> through the tetrahedron <m>S</m> with	vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>, <m>(1,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,2,0)</m>, and <m>(0,0,2)</m>.

    <task>
      <statement>
	      <p>
          The vector field <m>\vF=\langle xy^2,yz^2,zx^2\rangle</m> through <m>S</m>, the portion of the sphere of radius <m>3</m> centered at the origin having <m>x\geq 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
	      <p>
          By itself, <m>S</m> is not a closed surface. However, you should think about what additional surface <m>S'</m> you need to add to	make a closed surface, then use those pieces to apply the Divergence Theorem.
