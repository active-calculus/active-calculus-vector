        Explain why the flux of <m>\vF=\langle y,-z,x\rangle</m> through the unit sphere is zero. You should not compute any integrals as part of your explanation.

        The answer. Keep this simple as will be made public <q>back of the book</q>-style. <alert>Do not put anything with a number/or <attr>xml:id</attr> on it in an <tag>answer</tag> or <tag>solution</tag>, because this will mess up the numbering of subsequent things in the book. Technically <attr>xml:id</attr> is fine, but note that the reference might not be useful in the end. Definitely don't use <tag>figure</tag> or <tag>table</tag> in one of these things; wrap <tag>tabular</tag> and <tag>image</tag> in <tag>sidebyside</tag>.</alert>

    <introduction>
      <p>Calculate the flux of the given vector field <m>\vF</m> through the surface <m>S</m> for each situation below by using an appropriate triple integral from the Divergence Theorem.</p>

    <task>
      <statement>
	      <p>
          The vector field <m>\vF = \langle 2x+3\sin(yz),-4y+e^{x^2} , 7z+\arctan(y^5)</m> through the tetrahedron <m>S</m> with	vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>, <m>(1,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,2,0)</m>, and <m>(0,0,2)</m>.

    <task>
      <statement>
	      <p>
          The vector field <m>\vF=\langle xy^2,yz^2,zx^2\rangle</m> through <m>S</m>, the portion of the sphere of radius <m>3</m> centered at the origin having <m>x\geq 0</m>.

      </statement>
      <hint>
	      <p>
          By itself, <m>S</m> is not a closed surface. However, you should think about what additional surface <m>S'</m> you need to add to	make a closed surface, then use those pieces to apply the Divergence Theorem.
