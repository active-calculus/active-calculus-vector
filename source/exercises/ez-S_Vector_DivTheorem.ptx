        Let <m>Q</m> be the volume given in cylindrical coordinates by <m>0 \leq z \leq 3</m>, <m>1 \leq r \leq 2</m>, and <m>0 \leq \theta \lt 2 \pi</m>. Give an example of a vector field with component functions that are linear in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> such that the flux of the vector field through the boundary of <m>Q</m> is 17.

        <m>\vF=\langle x,-y,\frac{25}{9\pi} z \rangle</m>
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If <m>\vF=\langle x,-y,\frac{25}{9\pi} z \rangle</m>, then <m>\divg(\vF)= 1-1+\frac{25}{9\pi}</m>. Since we have a constant divergence and the volume of the region is <m>9\pi</m>, the triple integral of the divergence over the region will result in 25.

        <m>\langle 0, 0, \frac{25}{2} \left( \frac{8}{81\pi} \right) z^2 \rangle </m>
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We suggest a method like the the one done below but there are many possible answers. We will make a vector field of the form <m>\langle 0,0,\alpha z^2\rangle </m> which will have divergence of <m> 2 \alpha z</m>. Thus the divergence theorem shos that the flux through our surface will be the same as the triple integral.
        <me>
          \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \int_0^3 2 \alpha \rho \cos(\phi) (\rho^2 \sin(\phi)) \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta = 2 \alpha \frac{81\pi}{8}
        </me>
        If we want the result to be 25, then we can use <m> \alpha = \frac{25}{2} \left( \frac{8}{81\pi} \right) </m>.

          Using the divergence theorem and the fact that the divergence of our vector field is <m>5</m> will mean that the flux through our surfaces can be calculated by the following triple integral 
          <me>
            \int^1_0 \int_0^{2-2x} \int_0^{2-2x-y} 5 \, dz \, dy \, dx = \frac{10}{3}

          The vector field <m>\vF=\langle xy^2,yz^2,zx^2\rangle</m> through <m>S</m>, the portion of the sphere of radius <m>3</m> centered at the origin having <m>x\geq 0</m>.

	      <p>
          By itself, <m>S</m> is not a closed surface. However, you should think about what additional surface <m>S'</m> you need to add to	make a closed surface, then use those pieces to apply the Divergence Theorem.

        <p>
          We can use the disc of radius 3 centered at the origin on the plane <m>x=0</m> to make a closed region. There will be no flux through this disc because when <m>x=0</m> our vector field will have a zero first component. Only the first component will correspond to flux through the disc. 
          Using the divergence theorem and the fact that the divergence of our vector field is <m>y^2+x^2+z^2 = \rho^2</m> will mean that the flux through our surfaces can be calculated by the following triple integral 
          <me>
            \int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{-\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_0^{3} \rho^2 (\rho^2 \sin(\phi)) \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta = \frac{486\pi}{5}
