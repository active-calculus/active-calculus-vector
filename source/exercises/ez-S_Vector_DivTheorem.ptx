          Let <m>Q</m> be the volume enclosed by <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=1</m>, <m>y=0</m>, <m>y=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>, and <m>z=1</m>. Compute the flux of <m>\vF = \langle z^2-xy,4yz+cos(x/\pi),e^{xyz} \rangle</m> through each of the six cube faces.

        Explain why the flux of <m>\vF=\langle y,-z,x\rangle</m> through the unit sphere is zero. You should not compute any integrals as part of your explanation.

        Let <m>Q</m> be the volume given in cylindrical coordinates by <m>0 \leq z \leq 3</m>, <m>1 \leq r \leq 2</m>, and <m>0 \leq \theta \lt 2 \pi</m>. Give an example of a vector field with component functions that are linear in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> such that the flux of the vector field through the boundary of <m>Q</m> is 17.

    <answer>
      <p>
        The answer. Keep this simple as will be made public <q>back of the book</q>-style. <alert>Do not put anything with a number/or <attr>xml:id</attr> on it in an <tag>answer</tag> or <tag>solution</tag>, because this will mess up the numbering of subsequent things in the book. Technically <attr>xml:id</attr> is fine, but note that the reference might not be useful in the end. Definitely don't use <tag>figure</tag> or <tag>table</tag> in one of these things; wrap <tag>tabular</tag> and <tag>image</tag> in <tag>sidebyside</tag>.</alert>
