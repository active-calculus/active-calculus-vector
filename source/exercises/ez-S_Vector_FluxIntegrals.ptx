        <statement>
            <p>Compute the flux of 1,2,3 through a plane, a cylinder, a cylinder with top and bottom, and a sphere. Use your work here to answer: If S is a closed surface (explain what this is), what do you think the flux of F through S will be?</p>
        </statement>
        <hint><p>A hint! Don't feel obligated to use hints, but they are an option.</p></hint>
        <answer>
            <p>
                The answer. Keep this simple as will be made public <q>back of the book</q>-style. <alert>Do not put anything with a number/or <attr>xml:id</attr> on it in an <tag>answer</tag> or <tag>solution</tag>, because this will mess up the numbering of subsequent things in the book. Technically <attr>xml:id</attr> is fine, but note that the reference might not be useful in the end. Definitely don't use <tag>figure</tag> or <tag>table</tag> in one of these things; wrap <tag>tabular</tag> and <tag>image</tag> in <tag>sidebyside</tag>.</alert>
            </p>

        <solution>

        <statement>
            <p>Give F, look at plane. Example should have F dot N being constant. Show that the flux of F through the plane is constant times area of the planar section. Parametrize different parts of the plane and confirm?</p>
