              From activity 9.5.2, <m>\overrightarrow{P_0P_1} = \langle -3, -1, -1 \rangle</m>. The vector form of the line through <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> is <m>\vr(t) = \langle 1, 2, -1\rangle + t * \langle-3, -1, -1\rangle</m>. Using parametric equations, this is equal to <m>x(t) = 1 - 3t, y(t) = 2 - t, z(t) = -1 - t</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              To find the corresponding t-values for each point, set each coordinate equal to the corresponding parametric equation. <m>1 = 1 - 3t, 2 = 2 - t, -1 = -1 -t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 0</m>. For <m>P_2, -2 = 1 - 3t, 1 = 2 - t, -2 = -1 - t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 1</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              All the points between <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> will have <m>t</m>-values between <m>t = 0</m> and <m>t = 1</m>. Therefore, the line segment between <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> is defined for <m>0 \leq t \leq 1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>P_3, 7 = 1 - 3t, 4 = 2 - t, 1 = -1 -t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = -2</m>. For <m>P_4, -8 = 1 - 3t, -1 = 2 - t, -4 = -1 - t</m>. Solve each equation to get <m>t = 3</m>. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, line segment between points <m>(7, 4, 1)</m> and <m>(-8, -1, -4)</m> is defined by <m>-2 \leq t \leq 3</m>.

            <p>
              <m>\overrightarrow{QR} = \langle 15, -6, -20 \rangle</m>. We need to find a scalar (direction) vector in the direction of <m>\langle 15, -6, -20 \rangle</m>. If point <m>Q</m> is the initial point, then <m>\vr(t) = \langle -11, 4, 27 \rangle + t * \langle 15v, -6v, -20v \rangle</m>. When <m>t = 2, \langle 4, -2, 7 \rangle = \langle -11, 4, 27 \rangle + (2) * \langle 15v, -6v, -20v \rangle</m>. Solve for <m>v</m> to get <m>v = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, <m>\vr(t) = \langle -11, 4, 27 \rangle + t * \langle 15 * \frac{1}{2} , -6 * \frac{1}{2}, -20 * \frac{1}{2} \rangle</m>. This cooresponds to parametric equations <m>x(t) = -11 + \frac{15}{2}t, y(t) = 4 - 3t, z(t) = 27 -10t</m>.
