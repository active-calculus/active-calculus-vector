    The WeBWorK problems are written by many different authors. Some authors use parentheses when writing vectors, e.g., <m>(x(t),y(t),z(t))</m> instead of angle brackets <m>\langle x(t),y(t),z(t) \rangle</m>. Please keep this in mind when working WeBWorK exercises.

            Consider the moving particle whose position at time <m>t</m> in seconds is given by the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by <m>\vr(t) = 5t \vi + 4\sin(3t) \vj + 4\cos(3t) \vk</m>. Use this function to answer each of the following questions.

                The unit tangent vector <m>\vT(t)</m> is found as
                <me>
                  \vT(t) = \frac{\vr'(t)}{|\vr'(t)|} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{13}}(5 \vi + 12\cos(3t) \vj - 12\sin(3t) \vk)

                The unit tangent vector <m>\vT(t)</m> tells us the direction of motion of the particle at time <m>t</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                The speed of the particle is the magnitude of the velocity vector,

                  |\vr'(t)| = 13

                The distance traveled by the particle on a time interval <m>[a,b]</m> is the length of the arc on <m>[a,b]</m>.
                In this case,
                the exact distance traveled by the particle on the time interval <m>[0,\pi/3]</m> is

                  \int_0^{\pi/3} |\vr'(t)| \, dt = \int_0^{\pi/3} 13 \, dt = \frac{13 \pi}{3}

                There is a circle that lies in the osculating plane that has the same tangent as the curve at <m>t</m>,
                lies on the concave side of the curve (the direction indicated by <m>\vN(t)</m>),

                This circle is called the <em>osculating circle</em>
