    <introduction>
      <p>For each of the following line integrals:
      <ul>
        <li>Determine if the <xref ref="thm_FTCLI" text="title"/>
        applies.</li>
        <li>If the <xref ref="thm_FTCLI" text="title"/> applies,
        then find the potential function and use this to evaluate
        the line integral</li>
        <li>If the <xref ref="thm_FTCLI" text="title"/> does not
        apply, then describe where the process laid out in

      <solution><p>The <xref ref="thm_FTCLI" text="title" /> does
      not apply to this problem because the vector field is not a
      gradient vector field. The process described in the Preview

      <solution><p>The <xref ref="thm_FTCLI" text="title" /> does

      <solution><p>Based on the <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> component

        <p>Using the path of line segments from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(1,0)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(0,0)</m>, you can see the only part of the path where the vector field is not orthogonal to the path is from <m>(1,0)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m>. On the segment <m>(1,0)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> the vector field will have a strictly positive dot product with the direction of travel and the line integral over the segment <m>(1,0)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m> will necessarily be positive.</p>
