    <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>h(x,y,z)</m> be a smooth function of three variables and let <m>\vF=grad(h)=\nabla{h}</m>.
            <ol>
              <li>Write out the component functions of <m>\vF</m> in terms of partial derivatives of <m>h</m>.</li>
              <li>Show that <m>curl(\vF)=\vec{0}</m>.</li>
              <li>A vector field is curl free if <m>curl(\vF)=\vec{0}</m>. If the component functions of a vector field <m>\vG</m> have continuous first partial derivatives on an open region of space, then <m>curl(\vG)=\vec{0}</m> iff <m>\vG</m> is conservative. Need to fill out how this should work as an exercise.</li>

                The answer. Keep this simple as will be made public <q>back of the book</q>-style. 
                <alert>Do not put anything with a number/or <attr>xml:id</attr> on it in an <tag>answer</tag> or <tag>solution</tag>, because this will mess up the numbering of subsequent things in the book. Technically <attr>xml:id</attr> is fine, but note that the reference might not be useful in the end.

    <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>
              Compute the curl of the following four vector fields:
              <ol>
                <li> </li>
                <li> </li>
                <li> </li>
                <li> </li>
              </ol>
              Use a computer program to plot each of the preceding vector fields in the first octant and explain how the graphs relate to your calculations for the curl.

              Give plots of a vector field on the planes <m>x=a</m>, <m>y=b</m>, and <m>z=c</m>.
              <ol>
